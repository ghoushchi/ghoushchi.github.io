        "abstract": "The remarkable evolution of human society over the centuries has been driven by information. As information became digitalized thanks to silicon technologies, creating, sharing, and searching of data have become much easier. Most recently, scaled silicon technology has been at the core of this information revolution, as it forms the basis on which digital devices, such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, are built. As the feature size of silicon technology approaches sub-10nm, there are concerns that it cannot satisfy the demand for high performance devices through scaling any longer. However, through innovations in materials, structures, and processes, it will continue to provide higher-performance components to electronics systems for the coming decades. With performance-enhancing technologies, such as 3D ICs and Through-Silicon Vias (TSVs), and systems technologies on servers, clients, and interconnections, the data-driven world will continue to expand in the future.",

        "abstract": "One of the greatest achievements of human kind is undoubtedly its ability to build tiny machines that marry the functionalities of computers and wireless communication devices so cheaply that almost anyone in the world can afford them. Every one of us carries, at least, one such device in our pocket, yet we rarely think how in the world anyone could have created such a thing! Even the experts in our industry could not have predicted that this would have happened so quickly. What we have achieved in the course of the design and implementation of these sophisticated systems could be considered nothing short of a miracle, considering that billions of transistors have to work together flawlessly. (Well, sort of!) The reality is that some of these devices are now so complex that we need thousands of engineers to design, validate, and support them, including recovery from inefficiencies and bugs along the way. But, despite their ever-increasing complexity, the way we build these devices has not changed much over the past decades. Integrated-circuit (IC) design engineers blindly do what they are told - integrate as much functionality into a single device, believing that more is better! This more-the-better mentality is not surprising because we saw in the past that the more completely we integrate the cheaper things become. However, the cost and complexity of building billions of transistors on a single device is finally taking a toll on our engineers, which calls for new paradigm shifts in designing complex devices. If chip-design engineers had considered the financial optimization of the overall design process, they would have built things differently. They would have realized that certain functions are better grouped into highly specialized integrated circuits that easily and seamlessly talk to each other without compromising the overall system cost and performance. The key to making this happen is what I call the Lego-Block approach of designing integrated circuits. However, in order for the Lego-Block approach to materialize, we need to change the way we architect our devices. For example, we need to define a new chip-to-chip interconnect protocol, take advantage of multi-chip-module packaging and high-speed SerDes technology, redefine the memory hierarchy to take advantage of 3D solid-state memory instead of blindly increasing the DRAM size, repartition DRAM to serve different logical functions instead of building gigantic single-die DRAM to serve every function, change the way we build DRAM so that they are optimized more for performance and power efficiency instead of capacity, and redefine what should be done in hardware versus software. In short, we need to change our way of thinking, and be brave enough to reject common wisdom! If we fail to take action, soon we will no longer see cost savings. On the other hand, if we succeed, we will see life beyond the end of Moore's Law!",

While devices will change their nature and operate at higher and higher frequencies, their I-V characteristics will remain similar. In the near term, increased speed of MOS circuits, will be reached by operating deeper in weak inversion. Offset and 1/f noise will continue to play a critical role. Thus, in general, it seems that analog expertise is insensitive to technology change.",

        "abstract": "As there is no off-chip RF filtering available in a true Software-Defined-Radio (SDR), SDR receivers typically sufferfrom two fundamental issues when subject to large out-of-band blockers: gain compression and reciprocal mixing. Recently developed techniques based on passive mixers [1,3,4] addressed the first issue, with [1] notably achieving 0dBm blocker-tolerance and low-noise (Fig. 2.1.1 top left), yet they are still susceptible to reciprocal mixing (RM). Meanwhile, another recent work [2] showed a technique to cancel the RM by exploiting the symmetry of the phase noise (Fig. 2.1.1 top right). However, it is only capable of cancelling the RM caused by a moderate CW blocker (up to -10dBm), and lacks a front-end that is wideband, highly linear, and low-noise. In this work, we report a new architecture with phase- and thermal-noise cancellation to tackle the aforementioned challenges. The resulting design achieves 2dB small-signal NF and tolerates 0dBm blockers, yet incorporates no inductors even in the RF VCO. A low-cost wideband ring oscillator is integrated on-chip, and the phase-noise cancellation is capable of rejecting the RM when either a CW or a modulated blocker is present. This inductorless receiver achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art, breaking the traditional trade-off between LOGEN's power, phase noise, and cost commonly seen in all receivers.",

        "abstract": "The electrical-balance (EB) duplexer concept explored in [1-4] suggests a possible integrated multiband alternative to conventional fixed-frequency surface-acoustic-wave (SAW) duplexers. The basic principle of the EB duplexer is to balance the impedances seen at the ports of a hybrid transformer to suppress signal transfer from the TX to the RX through signal cancellation (Fig. 2.2.1). While the potential payoff is tantalizing, several challenges must still be solved before EB duplexers can become commercially viable. Specifically, the duplexer must provide high isolation and linearity in both the TX and RX bands across wide bandwidth (BW), with low insertion loss (IL), all in the presence of a real antenna whose impedance is constantly varying due to real-world user interaction. In this paper, we present a duplexer that significantly advances the state-of-the-art for two of these critical challenges: linearity and insertion loss.",

        "abstract": "Single-pole double-throw (SPDT) switches are a key building block for enabling transceiver time-division duplexing (TDD) when operated as a T/R switch or for eliminating imager fluctuations when operated as a Dicke switch. To provide acceptable compromises of IMF, Pout and sensitivity in transceivers or imagers, the switches are required to feature an insertion loss of ~3dB and an isolation of ~20dB. Recently, mm-Wave/sub-mm-Wave transceiver and imager integrated circuits have gradually migrated to silicon platforms for low-cost consumer markets [1,2]. However, the associated SPDT switches operating beyond 110GHz are developed using advanced SOI or SiGe HBT technologies [3,4] and rarely implemented in CMOS due to the lossy substrate and poor transistor characteristics [2,5].",

        "abstract": "RF-tunable blocker-tolerant receivers (RXs) enhance the flexibility of multiband multistandard radios at low cost (Fig. 2.4.1). The mixer-first RX [1] delays the signal amplification to baseband (BB) by frequency-translating the BB lowpass response to RF as bandpass. This raises the out-of-band (OB) IIP3 (27dBm) at the expense of NF (5.5dB) and power (60mW) due to no RF gain. The noisecancellation RX [2] breaks such a tradeoff by paralleling a voltage-sensing RX with the mixer-first RX. This achieves a better pair of NF (1.9dB) and OB-IIP3 (13.5dBm), but sacrifices more die size (1.2mm2) and power (<;78mW) to accommodate the doubled RF and BB circuits. In [3], N-path RF filtering and noise cancellation are concurrently attained in one current-reuse RX. That approach saves die area (0.55mm2) and power (16.2mW) at a high OB-IIP3 (17.4dBm), but requires a high VDD (2.5V) to widen the voltage headroom. Also, seeing that its NF (4.6dB) is handicapped by the input-impedance matching requirement (S11<;-10dB), there is no flexibility to get better NF. Finally, as both [2] and [3] involve two mixing steps, the LO power is penalized.",

        "abstract": "Wideband power amplifiers (PAs) with high power-added efficiency (PAE) are required by software-defined radio and high-data-rate communications. A PA in Class-AB, which can provide linear amplification with PAE better than Class-A, has been reported in [1] to achieve bandwidth larger than one octave. However, Class-AB operation generates a large amount of 2nd-harmonic current at the transistor output, which has amplitude as high as up to 42% of the fundamental current in theory [2]. An output matching network, providing optimum load impedance only at the fundamental frequency, is insufficient to achieve good power performance, bringing big challenges to integrated Class-AB PA design with octave bandwidth. In this work, we demonstrate a 2-to-6GHz (fractional bandwidth of 115.5%) Class-AB PA designed in 65nm CMOS. An output matching technique based on differential architecture, which enables the PA to achieve a maximum PAE of 28.4% and an overall PAE above 19%, is proposed to provide transistor output with optimum load impedance for both fundamental and 2nd harmonic over an octave bandwidth. Without using any pre-distortion, the PA can deliver output power of 9.31 to 11.31dBm with EVM<;-32dB for 256QAM signal (802.11ac format, 20MHz bandwidth) from 2 to 6GHz.",

        "abstract": "Integration of RF transceiver blocks along with the digital signal processing part in CMOS is becoming the trend in the semiconductor industry for lower cost and smaller form factor. Nowadays, the interest is even growing towards implementing the RF PA in CMOS technology. Cost reduction, diversifying means of fabrication and the addition of performance enhancement circuitry are the main reasons behind this growing interest. However, implementing RF PAs for 3G/4G standards in CMOS is quite challenging: The low breakdown voltage of nanoscale CMOS causes a ruggedness problem at typical average output power (Pavg) levels of 26dBm or more. In [1,2], power-combining techniques were used to reach PA output power (Pout) of 33dBm. However, amplification of signals with high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) requires also a high degree of linearity. Significant AM-PM distortions caused by the voltage-dependent parasitics are a fundamental problem in CMOS PAs. Thus far, predistortion is used to meet EVM requirements [2]. To overcome these challenges, this work presents a new class of operation, termed as Class-O, demonstrated by the design and the measurement of a single-stage PA implemented in 0.13\u03bcm CMOS and operating from a 3.3V supply.",

With this emerging technology, the PA efficiency is greatly improved, whereas the supply modulator (SM) itself needs to provide efficient and accurate envelope tracking for the overall performance of the SM-PA combined system (PA module). The ET technique, meanwhile, has seen limited use in high-power transmission due to the reduced SM efficiency for low output power originating from the linear stage in hybrid structures [1].",

        "abstract": "Spectrum-efficient modulations in modern wireless systems often result in large peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs) for the transmitted signals. Therefore, PA efficiency at deep power back-off (PBO) levels (e.g., -12dB) becomes critical to extend the mobile's battery life. Classic techniques, i.e., outphasing, envelope tracking, and Doherty PAs, offer marginal efficiency improvement at deep PBO in practice. Dual-mode PAs require switches at the PA output for high-/low-power mode selection [1,2], posing reliability and linearity challenges. Although simple supply switching (Class-G) is effective at deep PBO, it only offers Class-B-like PBO efficiency in each supply mode [3,4]. Multi-level outphasing PA requires multiple supplies and frequent supply switching [5], resulting in substantial DC-DC converter overhead and exacerbated switching noise.",

        "abstract": "High speed, mm-Wave silicon transceivers with \"Watt-level\" output power have become necessary in recent years to support multi Gb/s communication protocols over realistic data-link lengths. However, efficient generation of power at mm-Waves is challenging in modern silicon processes with low breakdown voltages. Recent efforts have demonstrated \"Watt-level\" power generation using both silicon CMOS and HBT processes , but with <;10 % peak Power-Added-Efficiency (PAE) and without the ability to support modulation or power control efficiently. mm-Wave power DACs have been reported before, but with moderate output power (~ 24dBm) and low peak and average PAE (<;7%). This paper introduces a Watt-level mm-Wave digital power amplifier with significantly higher PAE at peak power level and back-off compared to existing state-of-the-art. Using highly efficient stacked Class-E amplifier unit cells, a 28.9dBm digital power amplifier is reported using a 0.13um SiGe HBT process with 18.4% peak PAE and 11% PAE at -6dB back-off with 8-level output amplitude control. Several innovative features like supply switch-less Class-E modulators to enable peak PAE, and a variable characteristic-impedance (Zchar) transmission-line-based dynamic load modulation network to maintain PAE under back-off have been demonstrated.",

        "abstract": "Smart phones and their social apps drive tremendous growth of Internet and big data infrastructure. In turn, this spurs the insatiable need for data communication bandwidth between chips. In this context, wireline transceivers that push the limits imposed by process technology \u2014 in terms of data-rate, energy efficiency, and ability to support bursty traffic \u2014 are extremely critical. This session opens with the presentation of 3 complete 28+Gb/s transceivers addressing the challenges of high channel loss (up to 40dB) and multi-standard support. Two papers then address PAM4 signal generation/transmission for future advanced standards at higher data rates. The session concludes with a paper describing a dynamically enabled digital equalizer employed within an ADC-based link, a paper pushing the limits of rapid on/off operation in burst-mode links, and a final paper exploring calibration techniques enabling aggressive transceiver voltage scaling.",

To cope with severe channel impairments at 25Gb/s with up to 30dB loss at Nyquist, a feed-forward equalizer (FFE)/decision feedback equalizer (DFE) based transceiver without power-hungry analog-to-digital converter (ADC) provides robust performance. This work presents a low-power and area-efficient transceiver that employs a 14-tap adaptive DFE at the receiver (RX) and a 5-tap FFE at the transmitter (TX) for multi-standard applications up to 28Gb/s in 28nm CMOS.",

        "abstract": "As processing and network speeds are accelerated to support data-rich services, the bandwidth of backplane interconnects needs to be increased while maintaining the channel length and multi-rate links. However, channel losses and impedance discontinuities increase at high data-rates, making it difficult to compensate the channel. In this work, we target serial links from auto-negotiation in 100G-KR4 of 0.3Gb/s to 32GFC of 28.05Gb/s in 40dB backplane architecture. To achieve this challenge, there are two key techniques. First, we introduce a 36-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) to cancel reflections due to connectors because these reflections close the eye. To operate the 36-tap DFE, we need to fix a CDR lock-point and calculate 36-tap coefficients accurately. Thus, we develop a pattern-captured CDR with a 4b pattern filter to fix the lock-point, and a 3b pattern-matched adaptive equalizer (AEQ) to optimize 36 tap coefficients. These techniques enable our chip to compensate 40dB channel loss. Second, we target 100G-KR4/40G-KR4/10G-KR/25G-KR and 32GFC/16GFC/8GFC/4GFC. To operate across a wide range of data-rates, from 0.3 to 28.05Gb/s, with low jitter, we develop a PLL architecture with two LC-VCOs and one ring VCO with a data-rate-adjustment technique by controlling an LDO. Our test chip is fabricated in 28nm CMOS. Our signal conditioner is the demonstration to achieve the BER <;1012 PRBS31 at 100G-KR4 in a 40dB chip-to-chip backplane with two connectors by using the 36-tap DFE to cancel the reflection and to operate across a wide range of data-rates from 0.3 to 28.05Gb/s.",

        "abstract": "At data rates beyond 10Gb/s, most wireline links employ NRZ signaling. Serial NRZ links as high as 56Gb/s and 60Gb/s have been reported [1]. Nevertheless, as the rate increases, the constraints imposed by the channel, package, and die become more severe and do not benefit from process scaling in the same fashion that circuit design does. Reflections from impedance discontinuities in the PCB and package caused by vias and connectors introduce significant signal loss and distortions at higher frequencies. Even with an ideal channel, at every package-die interface, there is an intrinsic parasitic capacitance due to the pads and the ESD circuit amounting to at least 150fF, and a 50\u03a9 resistor termination at both the transmit and receive ends resulting in an intrinsic pole at 23GHz or lower. In light of all these limitations, serial NRZ signaling beyond 60Gb/s appears suboptimal in terms of both power and performance. Utilizing various modulation techniques such as PAM4, one can achieve a higher spectral efficiency [2]. To enable such transmission formats, high-speed moderate-resolution data converters are required. This paper describes a 36Gb/s transmitter based on an 18GS/s 8b DAC implemented in 28nm CMOS, compliant to the new IEEE802.3bj standard for 100G Ethernet over backplane and copper cables [3].",

        "abstract": "Emerging standards in wireline communication are defining a path to data-rates of 40Gb/s and beyond. Most previous standards for these networking applications use NRZ signaling. However, practical signal integrity constraints have led to a renewed interest in also supporting PAM4 for some applications and loss profiles. Recently, several transmitters have been reported that operate between 28 and 60Gb/s using NRZ or PAM4 modulation exclusively. However, high-speed SerDes building blocks that support both a wide frequency range and multiple forms of modulation provide more compatibility between components and avoid the development of multiple IPs. In addition, these blocks must continue to scale into the next-generation of CMOS process technologies to lower the cost by reducing area and power consumption. This paper presents a dual-mode transmitter (TX) implemented in 14nm CMOS that supports both NRZ and PAM4 modulations and operates from 16 to 40Gb/s. The TX incorporates a 4-tap NRZ FIR filter that is reconfigurable to drive PAM4 levels, quarter-rate clocking with a high-bandwidth 4:1 serializer, a duty-cycle and quadrature-error correction circuit with statistical phase error detection, and compact, multi-layer T-coils for pad capacitance (Cpad) reduction.",

However, the power dissipation of the ADC, as well as the digital equalization that follows, is a major concern for wireline receiver applications [3]. In this work, a hybrid ADC-based receiver architecture is presented that introduces innovations in both the ADC and the digital equalizer design. First, an analog 3-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) is efficiently embedded into a 6b time-interleaved SAR ADC, allowing for reductions in both ADC resolution and digital equalizer complexity. Second, significant power reduction is achieved by detecting reliable symbols at the ADC output and dynamically enabling/disabling the digital equalizer.",

        "abstract": "Energy-proportional operation of serial links is imperative for realizing energy-efficient data centers and low-power mobile interfaces such as MIPI. Burst-mode communication, where the link is powered-off when idle and powered-on when needed, achieves energy proportional operation. Ideally, a burst mode link must be turned on/off in zero time, must consume zero power in the off-state and must incur zero energy overhead while making on/off transitions. However, these requirements are difficult to meet in practice and as a consequence, the efficacy of burst mode communication in achieving energy proportional operation is reduced. The main challenges in achieving small power-on time and off-state power include the design of fast-locking PLLs, CDRs and achieving fast settling of bias node voltages. In this paper, we present a complete 7Gb/s energy-proportional embedded-clock transceiver that achieves less than 20ns power-on time while consuming 63.7mW on-state power, 0.74mW off-state power and 1.2nJ of total transition energy penalty per burst.",

        "abstract": "Supply voltage (VDD) scaling offers a means to greatly reduce power in serial link transceivers. Ideally, power efficiency at a given data rate can be improved by reducing VDD while increasing the number of multiplexed circuits operating in parallel at lower clock frequencies [1]. Though increasing the amount of parallelism is desirable to scale VDD, in practice, it is limited by two main factors. First, increased sensitivity to device variations (threshold voltage/dimension mismatch) at lower VDD makes it extremely challenging to generate equally spaced multi-phase clocks needed in multiplexed transmitter and receiver. Phase calibration methods can correct phase-spacing errors [2,3], but their effectiveness at lower VDD is limited as the calibration circuits themselves become sensitive to device variations. Second, as oscillator output swing reduces with VDD, its phase noise degrades, making low-noise clock generation difficult to implement with low power dissipation. Phase noise can be suppressed by embedding the oscillator in a wide bandwidth analog phase-locked loop (APLL), but conventional charge-pump-based APLLs are difficult to design at low supply voltages (VDD <;0.5V). Digital PLLs (DPLLs) can operate at low VDD, but they suffer from conflicting noise bandwidth tradeoffs, which prevent increasing the bandwidth to suppress oscillator phase noise adequately. In this paper, we present a phase-calibration method that enables the operation of a source-synchronous transceiver down to VDD of 0.45V. The energy efficiency and data-rate of the prototype transceiver scale from 0.29 to 0.58pJ/b and 1.3Gb/s to 6Gb/s, respectively, as VDD is varied from 0.45 to 0.7V.",

        "abstract": "The next-generation System z design introduces a new microprocessor chip (CP) and a system controller chip (SC) aimed at providing a substantial boost to maximum system capacity and performance compared to the previous zEC12 design in 32nm [1,2]. As shown in the die photo, the CP chip includes 8 high-frequency processor cores, 64MB of eDRAM L3 cache, interface IOs (\u201cXBUS\u201d) to connect to two other processor chips and the L4 cache chip, along with memory interfaces, 2 PCIe Gen3 interfaces, and an I/O bus controller (GX). The design is implemented on a 678 mm2 die with 4.0 billion transistors and 17 levels of metal interconnect in IBM's high-performance 22nm high-x CMOS SOI technology [3]. The SC chip is also a 678 mm2 die, with 7.1 billion transistors, running at half the clock frequency of the CP chip, in the same 22nm technology, but with 15 levels of metal. It provides 480 MB of eDRAM L4 cache, an increase of more than 2\u00d7 from zEC12 [1,2], and contains an 18 MB eDRAM L4 directory, along with multi-processor cache control/coherency logic to manage inter-processor and system-level communications. Both the CP and SC chips incorporate significant logical, physical, and electrical design innovations.",

        "abstract": "The SPARC M7 processor delivers more than 3x throughput performance improvement over its predecessor SPARC M6 for commercial applications. It introduces new design features, such as the S4 core, a 64MB L3 cache subsystem with application data integrity, a low-latency, high-throughput on-chip network (OCN), a database analytic accelerator (DAX), fine-grain adaptive power management and 1.5\u00d7 higher SerDes I/O bandwidth for memory, coherency and system interfaces (Fig. 4.2.1) [1]. The enhancements in the S4 core over the S3 core [2] include a new L2 cache scheme, support for visual instruction set (VIS) extensions, virtual address masking and user-level synchronization instructions to provide continuous single-thread performance improvement for SPARC processors since SPARC T4. In addition, a hierarchical modular approach, called SPARC cache cluster (SCC), is used for the core-L2-L3 cache system. Within the SCC, all four cores share a single 256KB L2 instruction cache and each core pair has its own 256KB L2 data cache. The L2 caches are organized as 2-banks and 8-ways to deliver greater than 1TB/s bandwidth to the four cores. This L2 system delivers 2\u00d7 more throughput for each core with 1.5x increase in size and the same latency as the previous generation L2 cache scheme. The L2 caches connect to an 8MB, 8-way set-associative partitioned L3 cache. Having a localized L3 cache within each SCC reduces L3 latency by 25%. The chip contains eight SCCs for a total of 32-cores with 256 threads and a 64MB L3 cache with 1.6TB/S bandwidth. In order to support the bandwidth and latency requirements from 256 threads and other system agents, the OCN architecture is implemented in place of a crossbar based network used in previous SPARC processors. Each SCC connects to the OCN, which in turn connects to four on-chip memory controllers (MCUs), coherency systems and eight database analytic accelerator (DAX) engines. The SPARC M7 introduces a customized DAX engine in an effort to optimize performance for Oracle databases. Eight DAX engines handle simple query predicates, decompression, message passing and interrupts across cluster nodes. This query accelerator provides up to 10x better performance for single stream decompression.",

        "abstract": "The next-generation enterprise Xeon server processor maximum configuration supports 18 dual-threaded 64b Haswell cores, 45MB L3 cache, 4 DDR4-2133MHz memory channels, 40 8GT/s PCIe lanes, and 60 9.6GT/S QPI lanes. The processor has 5.56B transistors on a 31.9mm\u00d720.8mm die in Intel's high-K metal-gate tri-gate 22nm CMOS technology with 11 metal layers and achieves a 33% performance boost, on average, over previous generations. Two additional metal layers enable area optimization and performance improvement. The design supports a wide range of configurations, including thermal design power ranging from 55 to 165W and frequencies ranging from 1.6 to 3.8GHz. Key architectural innovations include the addition of AVX2 technology, DDR4, and fully integrated voltage regulators (FIVR) that enable per-core p-states and uncore frequency scaling. Motherboard power delivery for high-performance microprocessors has become a significant design challenge that threatens the ability to cost effectively deliver high dynamic power at low voltage. To address this challenge, a fully integrated voltage regulator solution (FIVR) has been implemented, which enables several power-performance and platform optimizations. With FIVR, power is delivered to the die from a single mother-board voltage regulator (MBVR) at an elevated voltage of 1.8V, which results in a square-law reduction in power losses in the platform. FIVRs have a wide input voltage range of \u00b1~200mV which simplifies the design of the platform delivery network and enables higher MBVR efficiencies. FIVR delivers cost reductions by reducing the number of MBVRs and the total number of VR phases required. The socket and package also require fewer power pins. The result is that total platform power is lower in the FIVR design, when compared to a classic MBVR solution at iso performance and cost.",

        "abstract": "Recently, deep learning (DL) has become a popular approach for big-data analysis in image retrieval with high accuracy [1]. As Fig. 4.6.1 shows, various applications, such as text, 2D image and motion recognition use DL due to its best-in-class recognition accuracy. There are 2 types of DL: supervised DL with labeled data and unsupervised DL with unlabeled data. With unsupervised DL, most of learning time is spent in massively iterative weight updates for a restricted Boltzmann machine [2]. For a -100MB training dataset, >100 TOP computational capability and ~40GB/s IO and SRAM data bandwidth is required. So, a 3.4GHz CPU needs >10 hours learning time with a -100K input-vector dataset and takes ~1 second for recognition, which is far from real-time processing. Thus, DL is typically done using cloud servers or high-performance GPU environments with learning-on-server capability. However, the wide use of smart portable devices, such as smartphones and tablets, results in many applications which need big-data processing with machine learning, such as tagging private photos in personal devices. A high-performance and energy-efficient DL/DI (deep inference) processor is required to realize user-centric pattern recognition in portable devices.",

The RF operating voltage (V) and frequency (F) are limited by the delay of the precharge-evaluate read critical path. Traditionally, the operating V/F is set to ensure no read timing error across all data access patterns in the RF array in the presence of within-die (WID) parameter (P) variations, and worst-case voltage droops, temperature (T) changes and transistor-aging-induced delay degradations. However, many of these worst-case conditions and events are rare during normal operation. Therefore, these V/F guardbands can severely limit the best-achievable performance and energy efficiency in scaled CMOS process.",

        "abstract": "Precision operational amplifiers (opamp) with 30V supply operation have been widely used to support industrial, instrumentation, and other applications [1]. Most of them have been realized with BJT or JFET processes [1] to offer voltage noise PSD better than 10nV/\u221aHz and offset voltage drift better than 1\u03bcV/\u00b0C. Recently, opamps with similar specifications have become available using CMOS based processes [2-4], which can offer a cheaper wafer price. Auto-zeroing and/or chopping are used as essential techniques to reduce offset voltage drift and 1/f noise associated with CMOS input differential pairs. The switching action of those techniques, however, results in unwanted output ripples and glitches, which requires a post-filter and limits usable signal bandwidth. Increasing the switching frequency can extend the usable signal bandwidth, though it introduces DC errors such as offset voltage drift and input bias current. Maximum offset voltage drift of 0.02\u03bcV/\u00b0C and an input bias current of 600pA have been achieved [3], although the switching frequency at 60kHz limits the usable signal bandwidth. A high switching frequency of 333kHz has been achieved [2], while the maximum offset voltage drift and input bias current are 0.085\u03bcV/\u00b0C and 850pA, respectively.",

This beyond-the-rails capability is obtained by employing a capacitively coupled high-voltage (HV) chopper at the input of a switched-capacitor (SC) \u0394\u03a3 ADC. Furthermore, the use of correlated double sampling and system-level chopping results in a maximum offset of 8uV over the full CMVR. In contrast to a recent HV ADC [1], the ADC exhibits 30dB more resolution, while its CMVR extends below the negative rail.",

        "abstract": "Area-efficient low-noise instrumentation amplifiers (IAs) are required in various multi-channel sensing and monitoring applications. These IAs must be designed to achieve low noise and low power, good noise efficiency factor (NEF), good gain matching and low crosstalk among multiple channels [1]. For a continuous sensor array application, each sensor unit is conventionally connected to an individual amplifier for analog signal processing. This configuration consumes large chip area and high power. Furthermore, the quality of gain matching among channels is limited due to the independence of each channel. In [2-3], several multi-channel schemes addressing some of these difficulties are reported. This paper demonstrates a prototype capacitively-coupled IA (CCIA) that adopts an orthogonal frequency chopping (OFC) technique to realize a continuous two-channel CCIA with only one active amplifier, thus saving chip area and power. The whole two-channel CCIA, realized in 0.35\u03bcm CMOS, occupies an active area of 0.061mm2 (area per channel is 0.0305mm2). This 2-channel IA draws 27\u03bcA from a 3V supply. It achieves a low input-referred noise of 26nVA/Hz, reasonable NEF of 3.74, and good gain matching with mismatch of less than 0.55%. The average crosstalk between two channels is -83.2dB, which is about 10dB better than those reported in designs of similar framework [2-3].",

        "abstract": "Most systems require a voltage reference independent of variation of power supply, process, or temperature, and a bandgap voltage reference (BGR) often serves this purpose. For ultra-low power (ULP) systems, the BGR may constitute a significant component of standby power, and the system start-up voltage is often determined by the voltage, Vin, at which the BGR becomes operational. Lowering Vin can also allow an ULP system to continue operation longer as its battery or energy harvested input voltage decreases. The minimum Vin for state-of-the-art BGRs is restricted by VEB+VDS [1], where VEB is the emitter-base voltage of a pnp transistor, and VDS is the drain-source saturation voltage of a MOS transistor. Recent work brings the Vin voltage down to 700mV [2]. There is a need to reduce the standby power and Vin of a BGR to increase the lifetime of ULP systems. This paper presents a BGR circuit with measured minimum operating Vin of 500mV, reducing the Vin of [2] by 1.4x. Further, the power consumption of the proposed circuit is 32nW, which is 1.6x lower than the non-duty cycled BGR reported in [2]. A 2x-charge pump based bandgap core, a switched-capacitor network (SCN), and a current controlled oscillator and clock doubler circuit enable a BGR with a temperature variation of 75ppm/\u00b0C and power supply rejection (PSR) of up to -52dB at DC.",

        "abstract": "Due to the absence of internal nodes, inverter-based Gm-C filters [1,2] allow achieving bandwidths beyond what is possible with opamp-RC techniques. The class-AB behavior of the inverter, together with the high transconductance for a given quiescent current, results in a high dynamic range for a given power consumption when optimally biased [3]. The major disadvantage of traditional inverter-based Gm-C filters is that they are tuned with the supply voltage, VDD, and hence require a finely controllable supply. Voltage regulators used to accomplish this require a voltage headroom (including margin for tuning) and degrade total power efficiency by tens of percent. In this paper, we show that by exploiting body biasing in an ultra-thin buried oxide (BOX) and body, fully-depleted SOI (UTBB FD-SOI) CMOS technology, we overcome the requirement for a tunable VDD in inverter-based Gm-C filters, while achieving high linearity over a wide supply voltage range.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a discrete-time, fully digital, scan-programmable LDO macro in 0.13\u03bcm technology featuring greater than 90% current efficiency across a 50\u00d7 current range, and 8\u00d7 improvement in transient response time in response to large load steps. The baseline design features a 128b barrel shifter that digitally controls 128 identical power PMOS devices to provide load and line regulation at the node VREG, for a scan-programmable fine-grained synthetic load. A clocked comparator, which eliminates the need for any bias current, controls the direction of shift, D. The programmable mux-select signals, MUX1 and MUX2, provide controllable closed loop gains, KBARREL, of 1 to 3\u00d7. Since at any clock edge only 1, 2 or 3 shifts can occur (depending on the gain setting), fine-grained clock gating is enabled by dividing the 128b shifter into four sections and only enabling the clock to the section(s) where the shift occurs.",

        "abstract": "Bandgap references (BGRs) are widely used to generate a temperature-insensitive reference voltage determined by the silicon bandgap. the BGR generally utilizes PN diodes to generate both of proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) and complementary-to-absolute-temperature (CTAT) quantities and combines them to eliminate the temperature dependency. Though the BGR provides a robust voltage or current reference with insensitivity to process, voltage and temperature variations that is superior to CMOS-only reference circuits, it has received little attention in ultra-low-power (ULP) sensor applications. While CMOS-only reference circuits have recently demonstrated nanowatt power consumption, BGR approaches still have two critical factors to preventing nanowatt consumption. One is that PTAT generation assumes sufficient forward bias, VD, of the PN junction to allow eVD/(n\u00b7VT) to be much larger than 1 in the temperature range of interest, where n and VT (=kT/q) represent the ideality factor and the thermal voltage, respectively. In addition, the PTAT generation requires a start-up circuit to prevent the circuit from resting at the undesirable zero-bias condition. Since the start-up circuit utilizes a resistive voltage division between power rails, it consumes non-zero DC current, which must be larger than leakage current in order to ensure stable start-up operation. These two requirements for PTAT generation limit the use of BGRs in nanowatt ULP applications.",

The session starts with 3 papers on image sensors, including demonstrations of a back-illuminated stacked image sensor with highly parallel multi-sampling ADCs, the first 35mm-format image sensor for 8K video, and a low-power image sensor with a switchable \"always-on\" mode for mobile and wearable devices. The next 2 papers present a high-speed burst-mode image-acquisition system for scientific phenomena, and an event-driven motion detection system that uses in-pixel non-volatility analog memory for security applications. The latter part of the session presents recent achievements in the area of capacitive touch-sensing displays. This includes the first system where passive/active styluses and multi-fingers can simultaneously touch a 60-inch display. Another paper presents a system where touch is extended into the 3rd dimension for mobile applications. A 6b-resolution pen pressure sensor that uses a passive resonant stylus is introduced that can replace conventional costly Electro-Magnetic-Resonance-based touch systems.",

In addition, the emerging camcorder market typified by handsfree devices requires the simultaneous capture of still and moving images. To improve noise performance, a method of pseudo-multiple sampling has been proposed [1]. However, the noise reduction effect is insufficient due to the non-uniformity of the CDS period. For high frame rates, multichannel and high-data-rate interfaces have been reported [2-4]. For simultaneous capture of still and moving images, a seamless mode change has been shown [5], but it is necessary to convert a still image (full pixel data) to a moving image (2\u00d72 binning data) by an external DSP.",

        "abstract": "To realize next-generation highly realistic sensation broadcasting systems, the research and development of 8K ultrahigh-definition television (UHDTV) systems have been promoted. To realize 8K video cameras, 33Mpixel sensors [1-2] and a full-resolution camera system that uses three 33Mpixel sensors [3] have been reported. However, the weight of the camera with three sensors is over 40kg because the camera requires a large-format color-separation prism. To reduce the size of the camera, single-chip imaging is a promising approach, and a compact single-chip 8K camera that weighs only 2kg has already been developed using a color 33Mpixel CMOS image sensor [4]. However, a conventional single-chip camera has a lower image quality than a full-resolution camera because the total pixel count of the single-sensor camera is only one-third of that of the three-sensor camera, and pixel interpolation is required to configure a full-resolution image. In this paper, a 133Mpixel sensor that can be operated at 60fps to realize a full-resolution 8K single-chip camera is described. To achieve both high speed and suitable ADC resolution, 32-column multiplexing analog readout circuitry and 14b high-speed redundant successive approximation register (SAR) ADCs [5] are adopted. As a result, a full-size image with a data rate of 128.71Gb/s at 60fps has been captured.",

        "abstract": "Most mobile devices embed a CMOS image sensor (CIS) for capturing images. In addition, a variety of sensors such as proximity, ambient light, and fingerprint sensors are integrated for device control. The integration of multiple sensors in a device requires significant power consumption, area, and cost. In contrast to multiple sensors, an always-on CIS enables advanced smart sensing, including gesture sensing, face recognition, eye tracking, and so on. Smart sensing using a CIS offers a variety of user interfaces and experiences such as touch-less control, authentication, gaming, and object recognition for the Internet of Things (IOT). A major drawback of a CIS in mobile devices is that it consumes power greater than 50mW [1], and this is not feasible for always-on sensing that is required to function with the limited energy available from the device's battery. Moreover, power reduction in a CIS causes image degradation owing to reduced SNR, which is not acceptable for capturing high-quality images. Many low-power CISs have been reported [2-3]. However, they are inadequate for use as high-resolution sensors because of the requirement of additional in-pixel circuits for device operation at low supply voltages.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-high-speed cameras are a powerful tool for biology as well as physics and mechanics to analyze the process of ultra-high-speed phenomena. The frame rate of the state-of-the-art burst-readout ultra-high-speed silicon imagers has reached approximately 20Mfps [1,2]. To observe faster phenomena such as plasma generation in laser processing, the state of electrons in a chemical reaction, and so on, much faster cameras are desired. There are several factors that prevent the speed-up of the ultra-high-speed imager: high gate control voltages and high power dissipation for high-efficiency multi-stage charge transfer in CCD imagers, and the current density limit of the power and ground lines and RC-constant of the vertical readout lines in CMOS imagers. Computational imaging can be a promising option to break the design limit of solid-state ultra-high-speed imagers. Several dedicated CMOS imagers have been demonstrated [3,4]. This paper presents a demonstration of a single-chip ultra-high-speed multi-aperture CMOS imager based on compressive sampling. The imager performs single-shot burst-readout image acquisition at a frame rate of 200Mfps.",

        "abstract": "A vision sensor used to capture motion must operate with very low power when used in sensor networks where power is very limited. Frame-based [1] and event-driven [2,3] vision sensors have been reported. The former captures motion from the difference between captured data of a previous frame and that of a current frame; thus, it is difficult to capture motion of a slowly moving object. An event-driven sensor captures motion of a slowly moving object; however, its pixel configuration is complicated, and it is difficult to perform both motion capturing and image capturing. In this paper, we report a vision sensor for motion capturing having in-pixel non-volatile analog memory utilizing a c-axis aligned crystalline In-Ga-Zn oxide (CAAC-IGZO), a crystalline oxide semiconductor based FET that demonstrates very low off-state current [4] and retains captured data of a given reference frame. Although an electronic global shutter image sensor with improved floating diffusion (FD) charge retention characteristics is reported in [5], our vision sensor realizes normal global shutter and motion capturing depending on the presence or absence of differences with respect to a given reference frame in each pixel. The sensor has 3 modes: an imaging mode to output captured data in pixels, a motion-capturing mode to process differential data using an analog processor, and a standby mode to reduce power after motion capturing for each frame. Power consumption is reduced by operating only circuit blocks needed for each mode. The sensor (240\u00d7160 pixels), fabricated by a 0.5\u03bcm CAAC-IGZO FET/0.18\u03bcm p-channel Si FET (no n-channel Si FET) hybrid process shows power consumption of 25.3\u03bcW and 1.88\u03bcW at 60fps in the motion-capturing and standby modes, respectively, which equal 1/140th and 1/2000th of the power consumption of the imaging mode.",

While significant progress has been made in developing 3D contactless touch sensors for larger television and monitor type displays [2-3], the technology has yet to be infused into space- and battery-constrained mobile devices (i.e., tablets and smartphones). For successful insertions into these systems, a paradigm shift in touch-sensor system design is essential to enable seamless sensing operations with smaller-size, more tightly spaced, strongly coupled, and highly resistive display electrodes. In addition, any successful 3D sensing solution for mobile devices must consume low power and small silicon area to be compatible with limited battery and space resources.",

        "abstract": "Capacitive touch systems for finger touch have become widely used in mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, and so on. Beyond ordinary touch functions, some devices adopt an extra electromagnetic resonance (EMR) system [1] to support pens for advanced user experiences; these devices have been successfully commercialized for high-end devices [2]. Such devices offer a realistic and accurate pen-based drawing experience for consumers using a battreryless, light, and pressure-sensitive pen; this is possible because the EMR system excites a passive pen via magnetic coupling and senses the pen's returning signal that contains coordinate and fine pen-pressure information. As shown in Fig. 6.8.1 (top), an EMR system, however, requires an additional costly sensor board made with a flexible printed circuit board beneath a display panel to find coordinates of the EMR pen via a magnetic field and a dedicated controller, and it also consumes excessive power. If a capacitive touch system could cover the function of the EMR system, it would be a cost-effective and compact solution in terms of re-utilizing an existing system without the additional sensor board and EMR controller. In this paper, a capacitive touch system sensing a passive pen with pen pressure as well as a finger is introduced as an alternative to an EMR system.",

In ISSCC 2015, a new 64Gb MLC Flash in 15nm CMOS technology is optimized for low power. Another 128Gb V-NAND with 3b/cell is introduced at 1Gb/s I/O rate. A high-speed 28nm embedded SG-MONOS Flash technology is developed for automotive industry. Aside from memory technology, system level innovations are critical to achieve high-speed reliable NVM solutions. A frequency-boosting interface chip is shown to stack 16-die 128Gb Flash at 1GB/s interface. An SSD controller is implemented for high-speed and reliable enterprise-level SSD with TLC Flash. As SRAM and DRAM scaling faces serious challenges, high-speed emerging memories needed to continue area and cost reduction. Two Mb level STTRAM macro papers are shown to achieve sub-10ns read speed, potentially replacing SRAM and DRAM.",

        "abstract": "The demand for high-throughput NAND Flash memory systems for mobile applications such as smart phones, tablets, and laptop PCs with solid-state drives (SSDs) has been growing recently. To obtain higher throughput, systems employ multiple NAND Flash memories operating simultaneously in parallel. The available power for a mobile device is severely restricted and the peak total operating current may be high enough to cause large supply-voltage drop or even an unexpected system shutdown. Therefore it is important for NAND Flash memories to reduce operating power and peak operating current.",

For many years, every effort has been made to shrink die size to lower cost and to improve performance. However, the previously used node-shrinking methodology is facing challenges due to increased cell-to-cell interference and patterning difficulties caused by decreasing dimension. To overcome these limitations, 3D-stacking technology has been developed. As a result of long and focused research in 3D stacking technology, 128Gb 2b/cell device with 24 stack WL layers was announced in 2014 [1].",

        "abstract": "Accelerated advances in automotive technology, such as sophisticated real-time engine controls for higher fuel efficiency and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), are expanding the application range of Flash MCUs, microcontrollers with embedded Flash memory (eFlash). In addition to consistent demands for faster random access, shorter rewrite time and larger memory capacity in eFlash, there are increasingly intense requirements for robust operations and high data reliability under extremely high junction temperature (Ti,) of 170\u00b0C. On the other hand, along with device scaling beyond 40nm generation, the reliability of eFlash systems is constrained by not only eFlash memory cells but also peripheral transistors and metal interconnections. As oxide films in transistor devices and between metal interconnections are getting thinner, their time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) lifetime is critically degraded, which poses a great challenge in advanced eFlash design. This paper presents 28nm eFlash macros for automotive with four key features. The first feature is a 28nm split-gate (SG)-MONOS cell array with temperature-adjusted overdrive wordline (WL) voltage control to realize both 200MHz random access and more than 10\u00d7 longer TDDB lifetime of WL drivers. Second, we implement a high-voltage control technique to relax electrical stress on memory cells and peripheral devices by temperature-adaptive step pulse erase control (TASPEC). Third, we achieve high write throughput of 2.0MB/s by source-side injection (SSI) programming with negative back-bias achieving 63% reduction of program pulse time. Finally, we reduce RF noise by 19dB with a spread-spectrum phase-shifted clock-generation technique for over-the-air program updates while achieving a high write throughput.",

The CBSA can fit in conventional DRAM array architecture and use two normal cells in adjacent BLs, one for storing data \u201c1\u201d and the other for storing data \u201c0\u201d, for generating reference currents for CBSA. There are 64 CBSAs in a row of 8k cells, where one CBSA and two references BLs are shared by adjacent 128 BLs. STT-MRAM cell is directly accessed instead of page opening as in DRAM. By introducing CBSAs as sensing schemes, read-access time can be reduced to under 10ns with strong robustness against wide random variations of MTJ cell resistances with a small TMR.",

        "abstract": "Nonvolatile memory, spin-transfer torque magnetoresistive RAM (STT-MRAM) is being developed to realize nonvolatile working memory because it provides high-speed accesses, high endurance, and CMOS-logic compatibility. Furthermore, programming current has been reduced drastically by developing the advanced perpendicular STT-MRAM [1]. Several-megabit STT-MRAM with sub-5ns operation is demonstrated in [2]. Advanced perpendicular STT-MRAM achieve \u223c3\u00d7 power saving by reducing leakage current in memory cells compared with SRAM for last level cache (LLC) [3]. Such high-speed RAM applications, however, entail several issues: the probability of read disturbance error increases and the active power of STT-MRAM must be decreased for higher access speed. Moreover, the leakage power of peripheral circuits must be decreased, because the high-speed RAM requires high-performance transistors having high leakage current in peripheral circuitry [4], limiting the energy efficiency of STT-MRAM. To resolve these issues, this paper presents STT-MRAM circuit designs: a short read-pulse generator with small overhead using hierarchical bitline for eliminating read disturbance, a charge-optimization scheme to avoid excessive active charging/discharging power, and ultra-fast power gating and power-on adaptive to RAM status for reducing leakage power.",

        "abstract": "NAND Flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) have been adopted in enterprise storage applications that require high capacity and high-throughput performance. In recent years, a SATA interface supporting only up to 600MB/S throughput has hindered the accelerating performance growth of SSDs due to the host bandwidth limit. A PCI Express (PCIe) has emerged to close the limit because it can deliver 1GB/s throughput per lane and can be scaled to multi-lane to improve bandwidth. Accordingly, the SSD performance bottleneck has moved from the host interface to the NAND flash interface. In a memory system, a die-stacking technology in a NAND flash multi-chip package (MCP) effectively increases capacity and throughput performance in terms of PCB complexities and power consumption compared to a method increasing the number of channels. However, the multi-drop bus topology on NAND interfaces severely affects I/O speed degradations due to channel reflections and inter-symbol interference (ISI) resulting from large capacitive loadings. The undeniable paradox between larger storage capacity and higher I/O bandwidth has become a key challenge to reach enterprise-class SSDs. To overcome this issue, this paper presents a frequency-boosting interface chip (F-Chip) to boost I/O speeds while meeting capacity requirements. A 2Tb NAND flash MCP with 1GB/s toggle DDR interface is accomplished by incorporating the F-Chip into the NAND MCP including a 16-die stacked 128Gb NAND flash.",

This session presents a wide range of low-power digital-design techniques implemented in complete ultra-low-power microcontrollers for the Internet-of-Things (IoT), as well as in SoC building blocks exploiting fine-grain DVFS. The record-low power operation of the presented ARM and TI cores will prolong battery life in many IoT applications and enable energy-harvesting operations. These papers achieve both low-active power consumption, as well as incorporating techniques for efficient full-state retention. On the SoC side, innovative on-chip voltage and frequency regulation techniques enable operation across a wide range of supply voltages and PVT variations. This enables operation at reduced voltages and lower power. Novel voltage regulators increase energy efficiency and reduce voltage droops on the power rails caused by variations in the current consumptions of the cores.",

One challenge this poses is energy efficiency, as it will prove cost-prohibitive to regularly replace billions of batteries. Node cost is another concern, which will demand ever-greater integration. Ease of SW development must also remain a priority to HW designers. Addressing all of the above, this paper presents an 11.7pJ/cycle subthreshold WSN processing sub-system implemented in low-leakage 65nm CMOS, scalable from 850nW active power at 250mV to 66MHz at 900mV, with a fully integrated 82% peak-efficiency voltage regulator for direct-battery operation, and supporting 80nW CPU and RAM state-retention power gating for SW-transparent leakage reduction.",

These systems typically use a secondary battery to provide energy when the sensor is awake and operating; the battery is then recharged from a harvesting source when the sensor is asleep. In these systems, the key requirement is to minimize energy per operation of the sensor. This extends the number of operations on one battery charge and/or reduces the time to recharge the battery between awake cycles. This requirement has driven significant advances in energy efficiency [1-2] and standby power consumption [3].",

        "abstract": "With the Internet of Things (IoT) becoming ubiquitous, there is an ever-increasing demand for lowering power dissipation, especially for sensor nodes, where low energy consumption translates to longer battery life or operation with a smaller/cheaper battery. At the heart of a sensor node is a microcontroller running code from an embedded non-volatile memory (NVM). In order to support increasing computational needs and low latency (the ability to respond quickly to an event), the microcontroller needs to run at high performance (8\u201316MHz) and still have low power dissipation. Since most of sensor-node applications are event driven, the nodes, when not active, go into standby mode, to reduce power dissipation. In order to minimize the total energy consumption, it is important to not only reduce active-mode power, but to also lower the power consumption in standby mode, and have the ability to switch between the modes with low latency and low transition energy. Multiple low-power microcontroller implementations have been discussed in literature. Some, such as [1,2,3], aggressively address active mode power, but have higher standby mode power and also do not support CPU state retention. Other approaches [4,5], aggressively address the standby mode power, but have higher active-mode power, especially for code running from non-volatile memory. In this paper, we present an ultra-low-power microcontroller which addresses both active as well as standby-mode power reduction, and hence results in significantly lower total energy over a wide range of active-mode to standby-mode ratios (\"duty cycle\").",

At near threshold, it overcomes low transistor current at negative temperatures, the need for an extra digital supply IO, and the clocking power costs faced by the internet-of-things (IoT) and wearable systems. The system includes: 1) an all-digital single-supply open-loop clock multiplier achieving 1.51 pJ/cycle; 2) a 0.33V/0.45V dual-mode switched-network-capacitor DC-DC down converter from a 1.1V logic supply, reaching 75% conversion efficiency in both modes; 3) a closed-loop low-invasiveness timing monitoring system dynamically compensating device centering and temperature changes, enabling constant frequency operation down to -40\u00b0C at 20MHz (1MHz) in EE (LL) mode. The system fully exploits forward body bias (FBB) available in 28nm UTBB FDSOI with LVT transistors.",

        "abstract": "System-on-chip (SoC) processor cores experience high-frequency supply voltage (VDD) droops when the current in the power delivery network abruptly changes in response to workload variations, thus degrading performance and energy efficiency. Previous adaptive circuit techniques aim to reduce the effects of VDD droops by sensing the VDD variation with an on-die monitor and adjusting the clock frequency (FCLK) [1-2] or by directly modulating the phase-locked loop (PLL) clock output with changes in the core VDD to implicitly adapt FCLK [3]. The adaptive response time and complex analog circuits limit the benefits of these techniques for a wide range of FCLK and VDD operating conditions. The adaptive clock distribution (ACD) [4-5] exploits the path clock-data delay compensation during a VDD droop to enable a sufficient response time to proactively adapt FCLK. Although the ACD mitigates the impact of VDD droops on performance and energy efficiency, the previous designs require extensive post-silicon tester calibration of the dynamic variation monitor (DVM) to accurately detect the onset of the VDD droop. Since SoC cores operate across a wide range of FCLK, VDD, temperature, and process conditions, the DVM requires a unique calibration for each operating point, thus resulting in prohibitively expensive test time for high-volume products. This paper describes an ACD design in a 16nm [6] test chip with an auto-calibration circuit to enable in-field, low-latency tuning of the DVM across a wide range of operating conditions to maximize the ACD benefits, while eliminating the costly overhead from tester calibration.",

        "abstract": "In recent generations of microprocessors, there has been an increase in the number and types of processors integrated on the same die. For example, in [1] several IA (Intel architecture) cores have been integrated on-chip with a graphics processor. Multi-core trends are expected to increase in future generations with different cores and units requiring varying supply voltages. As platform footprints are also required to decrease, this causes a unique challenge for voltage regulation. In [2], an on-die switching fully integrated voltage regulator (FIVR) was demonstrated, which presents a very good solution in many cases. However, the FIVR requires inductors, which may not always be available. In addition, it may be desirable to sub-divide some of the FIVR domains using power gates and/or linear voltage regulators, such as low-drop-out regulators (LDO). LDOs can be used to enable different units of the chip to operate at their optimal voltage levels, which could save power. For example, different types of cores often have significantly different minimum-Vcc levels in low-power mode. In addition, a core or graphics unit could enter a high-performance mode, where the voltage is ramped up to enable performance, while other cores are in sleep or low-power modes.",

This paper introduces a 13mm2, 40nm CMOS 2G/HSPA+/TDSCDMA/UE cat. 4 transceiver that consumes 36/65mA battery-referenced current in 3G/LTE20 modes (B1, -50dBm TX, -60dBm RX). This is achieved in part by employing a multiport single-core LNA with a multitap inductor and a current-mode-driven single-core transmit mixer. Baseband-assisted calibration techniques help achieve <;1.2% RX EVM in LTE20 and >60dBm IIP2 in all bands. To save on platform area and cost, the RFIC supports single-ended LNAs, 32kHz clock generation, and free-running XTAL operation. TX SAW filters are not required.",

In [1] a fully-digital polar modulator is presented, which enables a SAW-less 2G/3G transmitter, in particular by solving the transmitter (TX) noise in receive (RX) band issues at various duplex distances (45/80/190/400MHz). Removing the TX SAW filter by adopting innovative transmitter topologies not only reduced the amount of external components, but also paved the way for monolithic power amplifier (PA) integration into the CMOS transceiver IC. This step poses additional challenges in terms of RX-TX cross-talk, self-heating and remodulation (unwanted frequency modulation of local oscillator by modulated output signal, very critical in IQ direct modulators, much less pronounced in polar modulators). The first integration of a PA with external matching network into a TRX SoC product has been presented in [2] for DECT cordless phones using GFSK modulation. PAs are also successfully integrated into a Wi-Fi TRX SoC, delivering linear transmit power up to 22dBm [3]. Following these earlier examples, this work proposes to fully integrate a PA capable of delivering more than 0.5W of linear RF power for the demanding 3G cellular applications.",

        "abstract": "Driven by increasing data-rates, advanced mobile communication systems impose stringent requirements on every transmitter design aspect. Especially when the inter-stage SAW filter is removed, FDD operation using high-order modulation schemes (as in e.g. WCDMA, LTE) demands both remarkable noise performance and linearity, which is difficult to achieve without sacrificing power consumption. On the other hand, the increased switching speed of nanoscale MOS transistors has enabled the implementation of various digital-intensive TX architectures [1-5], that improved system robustness and reduced power and area consumption even in face of decreased supply voltages. However, in these cases reconstruction filtering is hindered by direct digital-to-RF conversion, leading to increased quantization noise and strong sampling aliases. Often addressed by increasing the converter resolution [2,3,4,6] and/or sampling frequency [2], these solutions typically become rather costly and directly affect the overall power consumption. This work introduces a TX architecture that innovates by operating in the charge domain. Its incremental - rather than absolute - signaling improves both quantization noise performance and power consumption. Using a 128MS/S 10b DAC configuration, it achieves -155dBc/Hz at 45MHz offset from a 1GHz modulated carrier, with intrinsic sampling alias attenuation.",

On the other hand, smaller area and lower power are always desired for lower cost and longer battery life. This work presents a 28nm CMOS LO design for dual-band 802.11abgn/ac radio with overall architecture shown in Fig. 9.4.1. It addresses the aforementioned challenges with a low-noise integrated XTAL oscillator, a fractional-N digital PLL utilizing 1) background reference clock-doubler duty-cycle error correction and quantization noise cancellation, 2) non-periodic DCO dithering and compensation, and an offset LO frequency plan based on a self-mixing frequency tripler. The PLL design achieves 0.36\u00b0 integrated phase error or 0.17ps rms jitter while consuming 9.5mW, leading to a record FOM of -245.5dBforfrac-N PLLs.",

        "abstract": "As new complex communication standards employ various modulation methods in various frequency bands, interest in the software-defined radio (SDR) transceiver to support the standards is increasing. For the flexible transceiver, a digital-intensive transmitter has many advantages and has been pursued intensively. The efficiency of the transmitter chain is strongly dependent on the PA, and switching PAs, such as Class-D and F PAs, are used due to their high efficiency. A polar transmitter is suited for the switching operation and receives a large attention. However, a CORDIC is needed for l/Q-to-Polar conversion, and it is very complex. Moreover, the polar signal has a large bandwidth compared to the l/Q signal bandwidth. On the contrary, the quadrature transmitter that does not require the CORDIC, is simple and low computing cost with low power consumption. Due to the favorable characteristics, the quadrature transmitters have been studied. [1] employs an RFDAC based on a Gilbert mixer. It operates in a current mode and the output impedance varies with the number of on-cells. Due to the impedance variation, it is difficult to have a high linearity. In [2], the input digital code is processed by delta-sigma modulation for smaller digital bits and enhanced resolution. However the modulator generates quantization noise. In [3-6], a voltage-mode transmitter is employed with a power combiner based on a switched capacitor. The output impedance is constant, determined by the total capacitance regardless of the on/off cell condition. Moreover, this architecture delivers much higher output power and efficiency than previously reported works. [4] used delta-sigma modulation with cascade PWM to improve linearity. In [5], a quadrature architecture was employed to eliminate the problems of the polar architecture. Due to the 90\u00b0 phase difference of conventional digital l/Q LOs, the output power of the conventional quadrature transmitter has lower than that of polar, maximum 3dB lower when the magnitude of I and Q are equal.",

        "abstract": "Cellular multicarrier transmitters for communication infrastructure require both high linearity and large bandwidth (BW) at GHz frequencies. The combination of multicarrier GSM, WCDMA and LTE typically requires IMD<;-80dBc and SFDR>80dBc in a large transmit bandwidth of 300MHz and at an output frequency of up to 3.5GHz and beyond. Current-Steering (CS) Nyquist DACs have large BW, but their linearity drops for increasing output frequencies [1]. A separate mixer is therefore needed to generate an RF signal with high linearity. A Mixing-DAC integrates the function of the mixer and DAC together. Using a Mixing-DAC can result in different architecture trade-offs which potentially enable a reduction of the cost and power consumption, while improving the linearity at high frequencies. The state-of-the-art Mixing-DACs attain linearity by means of A2 modulation [2,3] or low sample rate [4], but this results in a limited BW and does not result in a linearity better than IMD=-71dBc. Even a GaAs implementation [5] only achieves IMD=-70dBc while consuming 1.2W.",

        "abstract": "With limited frequency allocation in the radio spectrum, spectral efficiency has always been the core development of communication systems. To accommodate the increase in demand for wireless data services, RF systems have been challenged to provide better in-channel SNR (EVM) and lower out-of-channel emission. As performance requirements become more stringent, second-order RF circuit impairments, that were previously insignificant, have become major design considerations. One example is the Long-Term-Evolution (LTE) [1]. Compared with previous generations, channel bandwidth has been expanded to 9MHz in most of the sub-GHz bands and 18MHz in the GHz bands. For spectral efficiency, the TX OFDM subcarriers are grouped into Resource Blocks (RBs) that can be dynamically allocated within the channel bandwidth. Noise and spurious emission requirements have become more challenging in the sub-GHz bands, so that Counter 3d-order Intermodulation products (CIM3) has been recognized as an important design parameter [2-4] for LTE RF systems. CIM3 is the result of the lower 3d-order intermodulation (IM3) product of signals at around 1\u00d7LO and 3\u00d7LO by using mixers with 25% or 50% duty-cycle LO. If an fBB tone is being fed to the TX baseband input, after the mixer and the RF amplifier, the TX RF output will produce the desired signal tone at fLO+fBB and an unwanted CIM3 tone at fL0-3fBB [3]. The adverse effects of CIM3 are shown in Fig. 9.7.1, using LTE Band 13 as an illustration. Band 13 has User-Equipment (UE) TX band from 777 to 787MHz, and RX band at -31 MHz away from TX. Extreme cases of full RB and single RB are considered. At full RBs, modulated CIM3 has a bandwidth three times the desired signal, and it folds directly into the TX channel, degrading the TX EVM and the 1st ACLR (E-UTRA). Furthermore, the ACLR of bandwidth-expanded CIM3 falls into the RX band causing desensitization. When single RB is transmitted, the CIM3 may fall into the restricted bands and violate the spectral emission requirement. Consider the Public Safety Band, where the LTE standard dictates that the emission from 769 to 775MHz has to be less than -57dBm/6.25KHz [1]. If the output power at the antenna is +23dBm and only single RB is being transmitted, the power density is 23dBm/180kHz. Normalizing to power density from 180KHz to 6.25KHz, the power density is 8.4dBm/6.25KHz, resulting in a CIM3 requirement of -65.4dB/6.25KHz. This is challenging for linearity, and also for noise requirement in the case of a SAW-less system. CIM3 suppression techniques such as harmonic rejection and power mixing have been proposed [2-5], but these techniques require extra calibrations and/or off-chip filtering components, which will be described in later paragraphs. This work presents a CIM3 suppression technique by removing the undesired 3rd-harmonic component in the LO signal through LO duty-cycle selection. With this direct root-cause elimination method, the TX meets CIM3 and RX band noise requirements for SAW-less LTE RF systems over process and temperature without calibration and off-chip filtering.",

        "abstract": "Modular smart phones have been attracting attention (Fig. 10.1.1) because users can freely customize their phones by purchasing modules and assembling them [1]. The transfer of data between modules is accomplished by non-contact connectors. Because the connection electrodes are not exposed, there is no wear or damage and waterproofing is possible. The methods of constructing non-contact connectors include capacitive coupling, which uses flat plate electrodes [1], magnetic coupling, which uses coils [2-4], and electromagnetic coupling, which uses transmission-line couplers (TLC) [5-7]. Capacitive and magnetic coupling can be used only for narrowband communication below the resonance frequency (<;1GHz). Because impedance varies with frequency, impedance matching is not possible for digital signals that include a wide range of frequency components. For that reason, these couplers can be used for the MIPI D-PHY data rate (1Gb/s), but not for M-PHY (6Gb/s). The TLC, however, can be used for broadband communication (>6GHz). Because the impedance is constant, there is little reflection and digital communication is possible. A data transfer speed of 12Gb/s has been reported for a distance of 1mm between couplers [5]. Thus, full HD (4Gb/s) or 4K (15Gb/s) video data can be transmitted over a small number of lanes.",

        "abstract": "Technology scaling has enabled RF-CMOS circuits that operate in the millimeter-wave frequency range (30 to 300GHz) where large bandwidths are available. These bandwidths can be exploited to increase data-rates of wireless communication links. Unfortunately, free-space path loss (FSPL) limits the operating distance of wireless systems at these frequencies. A 5-meter link at 120GHz has an FSPL as high as 88dB. Therefore such wireless links are feasible only with highly directive antennas. This work uses a directive channel instead. At mm-Wave frequencies, the directive channel can be a low-cost plastic fiber or hollow tube, made from PP, PS or Teflon. These directive channels will guide electromagnetic waves with low loss from TX to RX [1-4]. As such, RF communication through a plastic fiber becomes an interesting alternative and complements existing solutions like wireline copper or optical fibers. This paper presents an entire communication link that uses a continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK) TX and RX. We report on 120GHz 40nm CMOS TX and RX chips, the connector solution, and the plastic channel. Data-rates up to 12.7Gb/s over 1m, transmission lengths up to 7m at 2.5Gb/s and an energy efficiency of 1.8pJ/b/m for 4m and 7.4Gb/s are achieved for the complete communication link. All these results are for a BER 10-12. Compared to previous work, measurements also show the link still works for a bending radius of only 25mm, thanks to the selection of a high carrier frequency.",

        "abstract": "Advancements in CMOS technology have enabled exponential growth of computational power. However, data processing efficiency also relies on sufficient data communication bandwidth between different units of a computing system. Memory systems typically apply dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs) because of their high capacity and low cost. However, the multi-drop bus (MDB) interface between these units and the controller is challenging for bandwidth and power reasons. Multi-tone signaling has promising characteristics for this type of interface [1]. To keep up with the ever growing demand for higher bandwidth in multi-drop buses, we develop a 7.5Gb/s (3.75Gb/s/pin) NRZ/multi-tone (NRZ/MT) transceiver with a total link power efficiency of 1mW/Gb/s.",

        "abstract": "Emerging applications like cloud computing require high-speed low-latency access to high-volume data. In these applications, use of memory modules having multi-drop channels may be needed for time-efficient access to high-density memory data. A key design issue here is how to let interface transceivers not be affected by ISI and reflection noise generated by multi-drop channels having imperfect termination. The current-integrating decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) [1], which can cancel both high-frequency noise and post-cursor ISI simultaneously, has a limitation due to high gain-boosting and/or tap weight over-emphasis in equalizers to avoid eye closure caused by ISI-referred input pattern dependency. Duobinary signaling [2], which requires less boosting for equalizers by taking advantage of channel roll-off characteristic, is not effective in a multi-drop channel application because even a small timing or waveform variation due to high-frequency noise may cause degradation of the quality of duobinary signals. This work presents an integrating duobinary-based DFE receiver to avoid drawbacks described above and to increase the effective-data rate of multi-drop channels. A synergistic combination between the integrating equalizer and the duobinary signaling can provide advantages such as 1) lower gain-boosting for equalizers, 2) no need for precursor equalization, 3) ideally no input-pattern dependency during integration, 4) being more robust to high-frequency noise, 5) alleviated DFE critical timing, and 6) embedding DFE taps into duobinary circuits.",

        "abstract": "High-speed serial links integrated in advanced CMOS are ubiquitous in modern microprocessor systems. These commodity links have fixed performance specs and therefore realize the benefit of technology scaling in area and power reduction at high data rates. To realize significant scaling benefits, these designs must overcome the challenges associated with implementing analog functions in scaled logic-optimized processes while maintaining link robustness over a wide range of channel characteristics and third party components.This work describes a 2.5-to-10 Gb/s serial link implemented in 14nm tri-gate CMOS using logic-pitch transistors exclusively. The half-rate embedded-clock transceiver architecture consists of a 3-tap current-mode (CM) TX, an RX with a CTLE, a 4-tap integrating DFE, and a phase-interpolator-based CDR. It is 60% smaller and consumes 11% less energy per bit than reported links at comparable data rates and channel losses. It also introduces a baud-rate CDR algorithm that uses the real-time extracted channel response at the DFE to optimize the sampling point, relaxes the headroom/swing tradeoff at the TX driver by using dynamic signal boosting, eliminates the process cost for a precision resistor by using tunable serpentine resistors, and includes a low-power and low-area RX squelch circuit with a digital peak detector.",

The circuits are implemented in 14nm FinFET SOI CMOS technology and are included ina prototype receiver targeted to 16Gb/s serial I/O links for multi-core microprocessors off-chip communication. The architecture is shown in Fig. 10.6.1. Power efficiency and compactness are among the primary goals of the study together with an equalization capability sufficient to recover at bit-error rate (BER) levels below 10\u221212 data transmitted across smooth channels with losses in excess of 25dB at 8GHz.",

        "abstract": "Sub-harmonically injection locked oscillators provide a simple means for generating very-low-noise high-frequency clocks in a power, and area efficient manner [1-5]. Ideally, a free-running oscillator can be locked to the Nth harmonic of a reference clock simply by injecting narrow pulses at reference frequency (FREF) into the oscillator, such that FOUT=NFREF. In the locked state, the oscillator tracks the reference clock and its close-in phase noise is greatly suppressed. As such, the phase noise of an injection-locked clock multiplier (ILCM) is limited only by the noise of reference clock. However, in practice, there are several design challenges that limit usage of ILCMs. First, lock-in range (\u0394FL) of the injection-locked oscillator is limited. Therefore, separate frequency tuning, typically performed using a phase-locked loop (PLL) is needed to bring the oscillator free-running frequency (FFR) to be within the lock-in range, i.e., FERR= FFR-NFref<\u0394FL[5]. If FERR\u22600 (but <\u0394FL), injection ensures phase locking but causes a reference spur whose magnitude is proportional to FERR [1]. The second major challenge is the voltage and temperature (VT) sensitivity of ILCM. FERR increases as FFR drifts due to VT variations, which degrades phase noise and spurious performance and may even lead to loss of lock once FERR exceeds \u0394FL [4]. This is especially problematic in the case of high-Q LC oscillators because of their relatively small \u0394FL. Techniques to extend \u0394FL by reducing N or lowering Q are undesirable as smaller N mandates higher FREF and lower Q incurs a large power penalty.",

In cases where fine frequency resolution and low jitter are both needed, wideband fractional-N PLL architectures with quantization noise (Q-noise) cancellation are preferred. Phase interpolators (PI) are widely used in recent literature [1-3]. Although the Q-noise is reduced, decreasing supply voltages severely limit the linearity and noise of PI. In this paper, we present a switched-capacitor loop filter (SCLF) to solve this problem. The developed SCLF with correlated double sampling (CDS) keeps the output of the charge pump (CP) near-ground to improve its noise, linearity, and power-supply rejection ratio (PSRR). Furthermore, a calibrated 2b ADC is used to realize type-II operation.",

        "abstract": "A key challenge in high-performance I/O, as well as in reconfigurable radio and radar applications, is the generation of a clean clock signal supporting a wide range of frequencies. The introduction of fractional-N synthesis capability for wide-tuning-range applications enables generation of arbitrary output frequencies within that range from a single choice of reference frequency. A critical challenge in fractional-N synthesizer design is the cancellation of the deterministic component of the fractional-N \u0394\u03a3 noise, allowing fractional-N solutions to be applied even in noise-sensitive contexts. In this work, we present a flexible, wide tuning range, fractional-N PLL implemented in 32nm SOI CMOS technology, introducing two separate methods - one in the proportional path and one in the integral path - to process and suppress \u0394\u03a3 noise. The demonstrated design includes an integrated automatic calibration loop to optimize noise suppression, uses a dual VCO complex to support generation of any output frequency from 13 to 28GHz from a reference clock in the range of 15 to 300 MHz, and also supports extended tuning down to 1GHz through the use of configurable output dividers.",

Two other papers describe advances in positron emission tomography and functional near-IR medical imaging. Another major accomplishment is the demonstration of time-correlated photon counting with 14GS/S throughput. Finally, an intriguing technique for improving CMRR in neural recording, an enabling multi-modal cell-based drug screening assay platform, and a consumer-oriented ultrasound body fat sensor, enable advances in their respective fields.",

        "abstract": "Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), which is a nondestructive and minimally invasive manner and can therefore be applied to living cells and tissues, is a great analysis tool in fundamental physics as well as in the life sciences. Charge-coupled devices (CCDs) [1] and single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs) [2,3] are used for time-resolved lifetime measurement. In particular, SPAD-based time-resolved imagers have a high single-photon sensitivity and good noise robustness. However, they consist of a SPAD array with pixel circuitry, time-to-digital converters (TDCs), digital integrators to amplify signals, and readout circuitry. To implement the high photon-counting rate, a large number of TDCs and digital integrators are required. The spatial resolution of the SPAD-based time-resolved imagers is limited on this account. A recently reported time-resolved CMOS imager [4] using a draining-only modulation (DOM) technique has an attractive feature that a very simple pixel structure and 2-stage charge transfer without transfer gate (TG) can be simultaneously attained. However, it has a small aperture area, a comparatively low transfer speed, and multiple outputs are a challenge.",

        "abstract": "CMOS Single-Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPADs) offer the possibility to realize image sensors able to gather information about photon position, number and time distribution, enabling cost-effective devices for scientific imaging applications like fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), Raman spectroscopy, time-resolved near-infrared spectroscopy, but also consumer applications like 3D imaging. Despite the digital behavior of SPADs, pixels using signal processing in the digital domain suffer from very low fill-factor (FF), on the order of 1% [1]. Alternatively, analog counting enables compact electronics with 20.8% FF and down to 1.1ns time gating capability in 2D arrays [2] or 530ps in test structures [3]. Smaller technology nodes allow up to 26.8% FF, but high non-uniformity reduces the dynamic range and makes extensive external processing necessary [4]. Architectures with large off-pixel circuitry have been investigated [5] but demand high processing power and suffer from poor scalability. Time-resolved scientific imaging like FLIM requires fast time-domain processing of low-rate events, with high FF and repeated measurements. This paper presents a single-photon imager having 7T + 1MOSCAP per-pixel with photon counting and 750ps minimum time gating. Column-parallel A/D conversion allows for fast readout, and stable internal waveform generation is guaranteed by an integrated delay-line loop (DLL).",

        "abstract": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is a medical imaging technique for non-invasive detection of glucose metabolism in human organs, such as the brain, heart, and lungs. A positron-emitting molecule, generally Fluorodeoxyglucose-18 (18F-FDG), is injected and subsequently identified by coincident detection of two gamma photons released during the annihilation of an electron with the positron lost by 1BF-FDG. Conventionally, coincident gamma photons are detected through scintillation by two sensors placed at 180\u00b0 in a ring of identical sensors. In EndoTOFPET-US, two sensors are used, one placed in a semicircular ring outside the patient and the other placed on an endoscope. The endoscopic sensor is a miniaturized array of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) coupled to a mini-scintillator. To exploit the Fishburn-Seifert lower bound in timing resolution, a large number of photon timestamps must be generated, as is done in a multi-channel digital SiPM (MD-SiPM).",

        "abstract": "Time-correlated single photon counting (TCSPC) is a photon-efficient technique to record ultra-fast optical waveforms found in numerous applications such as time-of-flight (ToF) range measurement (LIDAR) [1], ToF 3D imaging [2], scanning optical microscopy [3], diffuse optical tomography (DOT) and Raman sensing [4]. Typical instrumentation consists of a pulsed laser source, a discrete detector such as an avalanche photodiode (APD) or photomultiplier tube (PMT), time-to-digital converter (TDC) card and a FPGA or PC to assemble and compute histograms of photon time stamps. Cost and size restrict the number of channels of TCSPC hardware. Having few detection and conversion channels, the technique is limited to processing optical waveforms with low intensity, with less than one returned photon per laser pulse, to avoid pile-up distortion [4]. However, many ultra-fast optical waveforms exhibit high dynamic range in the number of photons emitted per laser pulse. Examples are signals observed at close range in ToF with multiple reflections, diffuse reflected photons in DOT or local variations in fluorescent dye concentration in microscopy. This paper provides a single integrated chip that reduces conventional TCSPC pile-up mechanisms by an order of magnitude through ultra-parallel realizations of both photon detection and time-resolving hardware. A TDC architecture is presented which combines the two step iterated TCSPC process of time-code generation, followed by memory lookup, increment and write, into one parallel direct-to-histogram conversion. The sensor achieves 71.4ps resolution, over 18.85ns dynamic range, with 14GS/s throughput. The sensor can process 1.7Gphoton/s and generate 21k histograms/s (with 4.6\u03bcs readout time), each capturing a total of 1.7kphotons in a 1\u03bcs exposure.",

        "abstract": "In addition to minimizing input-referred noise and lowering power consumption, a good multi-channel neural amplifier system should be able to significantly reject common-mode electrical interference (CMI). The dominant source of CMI comes from capacitive coupling of electrical mains supply line or EMGs onto neural tissues and can be as high as 100mVpp [1]. Thus any neural recording setup needs a total common-mode rejection ratio (TCMRR) of at least 70dB for a minimum detectable neural signal of 5uVrms[1]. However, multi-channel neural amplifiers are commonly implemented with a shared reference input whose input impedance is several times lower than that of corresponding signal inputs [2]. This results in a large mismatch at the bipolar electrode-amplifier input interface [1]. As analysed in Fig. 11.6.1, the TCMRR is significantly degraded below 70dB, independent of an amplifier's intrinsic CMRR (ICMRR). In this work, we report a micro-power, low-noise 16-channel neural amplifier that eliminates this impedance mismatch problem by using single-ended CMOS inverter-based LNAs for both the reference and signal inputs. Compared to conventional replica channel works [3], when operating at 1V supply, the LNAs can accommodate a large input CMI of up to 220mVpp through the use of a common-mode feedback (CMFB) loop implemented through the supply rails of the CMOS-inverter-based LNAs, which coincidentally leads to a high amplifier ICMRR.",

        "abstract": "Cell-based assays are powerful tools to characterize cell- or tissue-specific physiological behaviors under external biochemical stimuli. External biochemical stimuli trigger endogenous cellular mechanisms that produce a cascade of physiological changes, resulting in easily measurable signals. Cell-based assays are widely used for large-scale drug screening in the pharmaceutical industry, where in vitro cultured cells are used to characterize the potency and toxicity of thousands of chemicals, leading to new drug development. This is particularly relevant in individualized medicine as patient-derived cells can test personalized drug responses. However, most current cell-based assays are conducted on single-modality sensors (electrical or optical only), which cannot capture the complexity of multi-parameter physiological responses. Sequentially transporting cell samples through different sensor platforms results in low throughput and potential abrogation of cell functions, while parallel monitoring of multiple samples with different modalities is subject to cell-to-cell variation even in a homogeneous cell population.",

Trends in inductive power conversion include higher switching frequencies, granular power delivery and support for multiple voltage domains, techniques leading to high efficiency over wide ranges of operating conditions, as well as approaches to integration of power management functions. Various solutions are required to effectively match source and load requirements in diverse applications. This session begins with three papers addressing control techniques for DC-DC power converters, followed by three papers that describe approaches to generating multiple outputs using a single inductor. The last part of the session is dedicated to circuits for inductive wireless power transmission. A highly integrated system and several techniques to increase the power transmission efficiency against the distance and load variations are shown.",

        "abstract": "As more features have been added to mobile devices, it has become necessary to integrate more DC-DC converters into the power-management IC. Consequently, there is a growing need for an area-efficient and simple controller design for DC-DC converters. A simple hysteretic control without any additional component for compensation is a very attractive solution because it is not only cost-effective, but also immediately responds to load change. However, a conventional current-mode hysteretic controller with low-ESR output capacitor, shown in Fig. 12.1.1, has an inherent trade-off between transient response and RC network time constant for emulating inductor current [1]. For instance, at a switching frequency less than several MHz, which is widely used in industry, the RC network occupies a relatively large die area because the capacitance CSEN of the network can be up to 100pF at a switching frequency of 1 MHz. Another issue with the hysteretic converter is its variable switching frequency, which leads to difficulty in designing an EMI filter [2]. To overcome these limitations, several state-of-the-art hysteretic converters have been reported that provide fast transient response and fixed switching frequency [2-5]. However, they suffer from noise due to the differentiator for amplifying ripple voltage [2], or need a large external or internal capacitor [3, 4], or generate high switching loss in the converter [5]. In this paper, we present an area-efficient quasi-current-mode hysteretic buck converter with fixed switching frequency. By employing a quasi inductor current emulator (QICE) with reset operation, the controller only uses a total internal capacitance of 3pF and provides fast transient response.",

        "abstract": "Multi-phase switching DC-DC converters offer many advantages in terms of high output power, low ripple, fast load transient response, high efficiency across a very wide range of load currents, and alleviated output filter requirements. However, the need for complex controllers that ensure accurate regulation and uniform current sharing between phases along with generation of multiple matched pulse-width modulated (PWM) signals complicate the design of multi-phase converters. Hysteretic control offers the simplest means to implement multi-phase converters and has been widely used in the prior art [1]. However, its nonlinear behavior leads to large output ripple, unpredictable loop dynamics, and wide variation in switching frequency (Fsw), which are undesirable in many noise-sensitive applications. Furthermore, they require current sensors to implement active current sharing, and generation of multiple synchronized PWM signals requires power hungry circuits [1]. A voltage-mode controller using a type-Ill compensator is well-suited for low-noise applications but it requires multiple synchronized and matched ramp generators that also incur large area and power penalty. A digital PWM generator can provide accurately matched multi-phase PWM signals thereby enabling passive current sharing, but digitally controlled buck converters exhibit large ripple due to their limit cycle behavior, have poor transient response, and consume significant quiescent current [2][3]. All these issues become even more challenging to address in high-Fsw converters because of more stringent loop-delay requirements.",

        "abstract": "Implantable biomedical systems usually operate in energy-limited environments and exhibit large variation of power consumption ranging from constant low-power (bio-signal sensing) to sporadic high-power (stimulation and/or burst data transmission) [1]. Thus, energy-efficient switching power converters that can support a wide range of load variation are necessary to meet this requirement. Pulse frequency modulation (PFM) power converters can support this large load variation with a high power-conversion efficiency (PCE) [2]. However, their unpredictable switching noise degrades the power supply integrity and hence deteriorates the signal quality in implantable biom\u00e9dical systems. Pulse-width modulation (PWM) power converters can provide predictable output spectrum, but their PCE in light loads suffers. Although various techniques have been explored over the past years [3-5], the PCE of the PWM converters is still not adequate for low current levels (<;100uA) that most of the implantable biomedicai systems consume.",

        "abstract": "Today's general lighting development is driven by improvements in semiconductor-based systems. It is expected that solid-state lighting (SSL) will dominate general lighting in the near future. Two main challenges that must be met in SSL are the reduction of the bill of materials (BOM), and an increase in functionality. In [1], a floating DC-DC buck controller is presented. This controller adds to the BOM, as every device of the power path is discrete and the ASIC can only drive a single LED string. In contrast to that, [2] offers a high-current fully integrated power stage. However, several external passives are introduced and the technology inhibits stacking multiple LEDs for high luminous efficacy. To overcome this, [3] presents an integrated HV power path with only the inductor as an external component. Ina parallel development, [4] reports an LED driver similar to [3], but that uses a discrete Schottky diode for asynchronous rectification. In fact, [1-4] demonstrate single output LED drivers without additional functionality or full color spectrum. To overcome these drawbacks in light spectrum and control, [5] presents a 3-channel LED driver. However, the external passives are numerous, which significantly impairs the overall BOM.",

        "abstract": "Reducing the number of large external components, especially inductors, is a very important issue for Power-Management ICs (PMICs). Single-Inductor Multiple-Output (SIMO) converters are excellent candidates to meet this requirement [1-3]. However, there are several issues with SIMO converters, such as cross regulation, instability and inefficiency at light load. Under normal load conditions, comparator-based controlled SIMO converters [1,2] show good cross regulation performance due to the fast response of the comparator. However, the switching loss remains constant and degrades light load efficiency due to the fixed switching frequency of output switches. The low-efficiency characteristic when any output is under light load condition is a critical issue that must be solved because a SIMO converter is very suitable for light load applications. In addition, the cross regulation issue appears again when any output is under no load because the output receives energy from the inductor every cycle despite the load condition. To solve these issues, a SIMO converter was previously reported to support Pulse Frequency Modulation (PFM) mode [3]. However, the mode change control method increases the complexity of the control loop, which makes it unsuitable for a multi-output SIMO converter. In this paper, an Error Based Controlled (EBC) SIMO converter is presented to resolve the problems raised above using load-dependent Adaptive Pulse Modulation (APM). A hybrid topology composed of a switching converter and a linear regulator is also presented to minimize the cross regulation issue. To highlight the advantages, a 10-output SIMO converter is designed.",

        "abstract": "Single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) DC-DC buck converters, which possess the advantage of compact size, are commonly implemented in portable electronics like mobile phones and tablets. However, their power efficiency is degraded considerably, as illustrated in Fig. 12.6.1, when multiple outputs are requested in a wide range, such as 1.2 to 3.3V for tablets. The use of P-MOSFET [1][2] and N-MOSFET [3] switches results in low efficiency of 64 and 70% at outputs of 1.2 and 3.3V, respectively, because of low gate driving voltages and large on-resistance. This implies that conventional usage of P-MOSFET and N-MOSFET switches is inappropriate in SIMO converters [1-3]. This paper presents a SIMO converter with output-independent gate drive (OIGD) control for all N-MOSFET switches. One of the salient features is that OIGD control achieves output-voltage-independent characteristics on efficiency and keeps peak efficiency of 90% over the range of 1.2 to 3.3V for tablets. The other salient feature is that a low-power deadtime overstress recycling (DOR) technique retrieves 95% of energy loss during deadtime and releases the overstress problem simultaneously.",

        "abstract": "A wide variety of applications can benefit from near-field wireless power transfer using coupled inductive links, such as wireless sensors and implantable microelectronic devices. The use of inductive power transmission is expected to see an explosive growth over the next decade as engineers try to cut the last cord from mobile electronics, small home appliances, and even electric vehicles [1]. The inductive link power transfer efficiency (PTE) is highly dependent of the loading of the receiver (Rx) coil, referred to as RL. As shown in Fig. 12.7.1a, magnetic resonance-based power transmission in the form of a 3-coil link has been proposed to maximize PTE for any given RL by transforming it to an optimal load, using k34 variable [2,3]. Alternatively, an off-chip matching circuit has been used to transform RL [4]. However, these methods need either an additional coil or a network of off-chip capacitors and inductors, which add to the size/cost of Rx. Moreover, in the above applications, RL can change drastically during operation and there is a need for Rx to dynamically compensate for a wide range of RL to maintain high PTE.",

        "abstract": "Wireless power transfer (WPT) in the range of 10 to 100mW [1] is widely used in impiantale medical devices (IMDs) to eliminate the use of a battery. Due to load and coupling variations, the output voltage of the rectifier VOUT is not steady. In [1-2], a 1X/2X reconfigurable rectifier was reported to uphold VOUT when the coupling coils move apart. In [3], VOUT is regulated by the transmitter with feedback through a wire, which defeats the purpose of WPT. In [4], VOUT is regulated by a resonant regulating rectifier as well as an MCU-controlled transmitter with feedback still through a wire. In [5], a reconfigurable resonant regulating (R3) rectifier is reported for VOUT regulation, but the load and coupling ranges are limited. In the R3 rectifier, the 1X/2X rectifier works as a bridge rectifier in 1X mode with VOUT equal to V1X, and as a voltage doubler in 2X mode with VOUT equal to V2X as shown by the dash lines in the HSPICE simulated results in Fig. 12.8.1. VOUT is regulated within [V1X, V2X] by adjusting the duty cycle of mode-switching through the PWM control under the condition that V2X>V1X; otherwise, the PWM control is not stable. This restricts the workable load resistance RL to be larger than the boundary RLa. For a smaller coupling factor k, RLa is larger (load current is smaller), and thus the coupling range is also limited. In this work, a primary equalizer is introduced to tackle these limitations to extend the load and coupling ranges.",

        "abstract": "Wireless power transfer (WPT) systems are becoming ubiquitous with applications in powering medical implants and a range of portable consumer electronic devices such as smart phones and wearable devices. Wireless power transferring methods can be classified into two types: inductive and resonant. For the resonant type, wider-range power transfer is possible, and multiple devices with different power requirements can be charged at the same time. The Alliance for Wireless Power (A4WP) has chosen the 6.78MHz ISM band as the power-transfer frequency [1]. At 6.78MHz, the associated switching loss is an order of magnitude larger than that in a typical wireless receiver based on an inductive coupling, with a carrier frequency of around 200kHz. Besides the two fundamental aspects of switching frequency and power, there is a third important parameter, notably the higher input voltage range needed for the \u2018loosely coupled\u2019 resonant type, which is 25V maximum for this work. Ref. [2] appears to be one of few works that can be entirely related to the current work, targeting the same application. However, it does not integrate the most critical parts of the receiver, such as the AC-DC rectifier. Other works in the same frequency range are either limited to low-power applications [3] or the AC-DC rectifier is a stand-alone chip [4-5].",

Most of the previously reported ULP receivers (RXs) are developed as single-channel devices focusing on low power consumption while adopting a high-Q MEMS device or a crystal oscillator (XO). However, for proper utilization of the IoT, e.g., accommodating multiple sensors at the same time and place, multichannel operation is essential. There have been reports of super-regenerative and injection-locking-based FSK RXs as multichannel radios with a limited signal-to-interferer ratio (SIR), making them susceptible to the adjacent channel interferers. In the paper, a 2-tone modulation scheme that sacrifices the spectral efficiency and data-rate is adopted for in-band interference tolerance. For multichannel operation with an adequate SIR, downconversion is an optimum solution. However, the power burden of PLL-based LO generation impedes its adoption for ULP RX. This work focuses on reducing the power of LO generation blocks in the ULP OOK RX. Considering the relaxed frequency stability requirement of OOK modulation, a receiver-based FLL (RBFLL) that adopts the RX chain as a part of the FLL as a substitute to the power-hungry divider is proposed. Implemented in 65nm CMOS, a 2.4GHz multichannel ULP OOK RX with the RBFLL achieves -83dBm sensitivity at 1 Mb/s while dissipating 227\u03bcW from a 0.6V supply.",

        "abstract": "Wireless sensor nodes present a difficult compromise at the system level between low power consumption, interference resilience and ease/size of the application. Recent low-power designs employ receiver architectures in which the LO runs at or below the received frequency (in TX at the required RF frequency). These architectures facilitate LO generation and distribution at a favorably low frequency, but cause a systematic, hard-to-circumvent susceptibility to out-of-band blockers in RX [1] and pulling in TX [1,2]. The presented Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) transceiver, as shown in Fig. 13.3.1, was purposely designed with a classic double-frequency VCO architecture to avoid these inherent weaknesses, but still significantly reduces the power consumption of designs of the same architecture [3,4]. In order to ease application, an on-chip DC-DC converter supports battery operation between 0.9V and 3.3V. An on-chip T/R switch, RX balun and impedance matching allow 50\u03a9 chip antennae to be used directly on the single-ended RFIO pin, without the need for external RF filtering. This enables minimum-sized modules and a fast time-to-market.",

The SIF architecture, however, involves RF image blocking violation without exception rule or the use of additional off-chip filters. In the TX, meanwhile, the calibration incurs a weakness in terms of the offset issue. Moreover, there is no approach to achieve \"zero\" external components for the RF port. In this paper, a BLE transceiver, with a reconfigurable filter, embedded into an on-chip matching network without any external components, is presented.",

Moreover, such sensor nodes should be ultra-low-cost compact objects. This paper presents a 2.4GHz WuRX with -97dBm sensitivity for 10kb/s and 103 BER, operated from a single 0.5V supply. On-off keying (OOK) modulation has been chosen for its energy efficiency, with a cascaded multilayer N-path filter approach offering superb interferer rejection while avoiding expensive off-chip resonant components such as BAWs or crystals.",

        "abstract": "One of the main goals for the next generation of radios for wireless sensor and body-area networks (WSN and WBAN) is a sub-mW receiver (RX) compliant with energy-harvested supplies. In this direction, the Bluetooth standard has introduced a low-energy operative mode (BLE) with wider channel spacing (2MHz) and relaxed blocker tolerance. The minimum sensitivity required is \u221270dBm but even with a sensitivity 10dB lower the BLE receiver can have a noise figure close to 19dB [1]. Although linearity and noise specs have been significantly relaxed, the design of a sub-mW solution remains challenging since the power dissipation cannot be simply scaled with the spurious-free-dynamic-range (SFDR). In fact, the ultimate bound is set by the power burned in the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which is used for the generation of the local oscillator (LO) necessary for the signal downconversion. Since, for a targeted phase noise, the current required by the VCO is inversely proportional to the quality factor of the resonator adopted, a straightforward approach is to use a high-Q tank like the FBAR used by Wang et al. [2]. However in low-cost CMOS processes, when high-Q resonators are not present, an alternative strategy is to share the VCO bias current with the other blocks of the RF front-end as in the LMV cell proposed by Tedeschi et al. [3].",

        "abstract": "Although it is obvious that using a trillion sensor nodes for wireless sensor network (WSN) application would deeply exacerbate the spectral congestion issue, RF-powered sensor nodes [1,2] still support only low spectral-efficiency modulation such as OOK. State-of-the-art standard-compliant RF transceivers for low-power applications have been achieving multilevel modulation such as n/8 D8PSK [3], but their power consumption is as large as 1mW without PA even in the 400MHz band because of the large power consumption of the RF synthesizer, which is required to provide high-frequency accuracy and low phase noise for multilevel modulation. This work presents an IF-based quadrature backscattering technique, enabling n-PSK and n-QAM without an RF PLL. The presented technique exploits the passive RFID technologies, but can realize both amplitude and phase modulation concurrently. Our TX in 65nm Si CMOS achieves spectral efficiency of 3.3b/s/Hz with 32QAM while consuming 113uW with a 0.6V power supply in our measurements, which has 6.6 times better spectral efficiency than previous RF-powered wireless transceivers [1,2]. The prototype RF-powered sensor node with our transceiver including the TX, RX, and an RF energy harvester (RF-EH), succeeds in a wireless temperature-sensing application.",

        "abstract": "Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are a crucial building block in modern Systems-on-Chip (SoCs), which contain microprocessors, I/O interfaces, memories, power management, and communication systems. Fully synthesizable PLLs [1-2], designed using a pure digital design flow, have been proposed to reduce the design cost and allow easier integration. To achieve high-frequency resolution, PLLs are required to operate in fractional-N mode, in addition to integer-N mode. There are several architectures available [5-6] for realizing fractional-N operation. However, the existing topologies are not well suited for synthesis, as they require a time-to-digital converter (TDC) [3] and a digital-to-time converter (DTC) [4-5]. TDCs and DTCs are vulnerable to layout uncertainty, arising from automatic place and route (P&R), introducing linearity degradation and leading to poor in-band and out-of-band phase noise in PLLs. Injection locking is a promising technique for synthesizable PLLs. Unfortunately, it suffers from large spur caused by a periodic hard refresh, and limited fractional resolution, which is bounded to the inverse of the number of ring oscillator delay stages [6]. This paper describes a fully synthesizable fractional-N PLL with a soft injection-locking technique for smoothing switching and fine fractional resolution, and a cascading topology for suppressing the free-running oscillator phase noise over a wide loop bandwidth.",

Recently, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) were proposed as a secure method for chip authentication in unsecure environments [5-7]. A PUF is a function that maps an input code (\"challenge') to an output code (\u201cresponse\u201d) in a manner that is unique for every chip. PUFs are increasingly used for IC authentication to offer protection against identity theft, cloning, and counterfeit components [2-4].",

        "abstract": "Since the advent of digital PLLs (DPLLs), various techniques have been proposed fora low-power, low-noise fractional-N frequency synthesizer. Among the various innovations, a reference-multiplied architecture offers distinct advantages compared to conventional DPLLs [1]. First, low quantization noise (q-noise) can be achieved without complex q-noise cancellation schemes, since the delta-sigma modulator (DSM) has a high oversampling ratio and its q-noise is pushed to higher frequencies. Second, noise requirements of PLL building blocks become less stringent as the division value is reduced. For a digital PLL using a Nyquist-rate time-to-digital converter (TDC), if the reference is multiplied by N the time resolution of the TDC can be reduced by \u221aN for the same noise level. Unfortunately, one drawback of the reference-multiplied PLL is the increase in power and complexity due to the reference-multiplying circuit. In this paper, we propose a reference-multiplied digital fractional-N PLL that has negligible overhead in the reference-multiplying circuit. To save power, a frequency-multiplied TDC (FMTDC) consisting of an open-loop multiplying DLL (MDLL) and a Vernier delay-line (VDL) TDC is proposed, which share their delay lines. High spurious tone coming from the open-loop MDLL is canceled by an adaptive filter located between TDC and loop filter.",

        "abstract": "All-digital phase-locked loops (ADPLLs) offer faster locking time, easier portability and better performance in advanced semiconductor processes as compared to analog PLLs. Advanced FinFET devices exhibit better gm and ION than planar devices [1], but they are offered only in a limited number of device sizes, thus precluding their use in traditional analog design styles. In an ADPLL, the transistors are used as switches with little regard to their linear analog properties. Hence, ADPLL performance should improve with the adoption of FinFET devices. Inverter delay in a 16nm FinFET process is less than half of that in a 28nm planar process, improving in-band phase noise (PN) by around 6dB [2]. Ring-type digitally controlled oscillators (DCOs) provide wide frequency tuning range (FTR), but poor PN performance degrades the ADPLL figure of merit (FoM) [3]. Achieving an FoM better than -225dB using a ring DCO is a challenge. In this work, we presenta 0.25-to-4GHz, 1.22ps integrated jitter and -228.6dB FoM fractional-N ADPLL with spread-spectrum clocking (SSC) capability in 16nm FinFET CMOS.",

Reduced supply voltages and increased transistor density affords SoCs composed of multiple clusters of CPUs and additional specialized compute engines. However, this comes at the cost of both increasing current, and increasing current density, to the extent that these systems are ultimately constrained by power delivery. Pathological AC supply noise conditions may arise due to sporadic combinations of system and micro-architectural events, and these effectively limit the energy efficiency of the system, as sufficient voltage margin must be deployed to guarantee these conditions do not result in system failure.",

        "abstract": "SRAM register files have sensitive circuitry and often operate with high switching activity and at high temperature. This makes them particularly vulnerable to aging by negative-bias temperature instability (NBTI) degradation of their PMOS devices. We propose a technique to sense this aging degradation; it is an in-situ technique sensing the threshold voltage (Vt) of PMOSs directly in bitcells, and can operate in-field, thanks to the ability to sense V, robustly across temperature and voltage variations. This technique can be foundational for several dynamic reliability management (DRM) approaches, including: 1) sensing V, values periodically (e.g., every several months) for evaluating the amount and the rate of NBTI degradation; 2) sensing V, differences between two PMOSs in a bitcell to determine their strength skew and to estimate the minimum functional voltage (VMIN) degradation; and, 3) using the skew information across bitcells to create recovery vectors, which can be used to recover the aged PMOSs and thereby rebalance the skews. Existing in-situ techniques using ring oscillators or current sensors to sense bitcell reliability and performance cannot support in-field operation, which is a critical issue for DRM since it is impractical to control environmental parameters, particularly temperature, during sensing.",

        "abstract": "The race to deep sub-micron CMOS technology has resulted in a change in device architectures, from a planar structure to a FinFET to achieve decreased leakage, further downscaling, and better sub-threshold slope, even under a lower power supply. Downscaling trends have forced the analog semiconductor industry to move to the digital domain to maintain functionality in light of increasing short-channel effects and device mismatch. Furthermore, the main goal of the new technology is to achieve faster speed and lower cost. In leading-edge processes and design environments, conventional analog PLLs in systems-on-chip (SoCs) are being replaced by digitally operated PLLs to meet clock requirements for optimal overall system performance. While a widely used time-to-digital converter (TDC)-based digital PLL (TDC-DPLL) has a linear loop characteristic, which is simple and analogous to well-known analog PLLs, it has to overcome noise issues from TDC quantization error and phase noise from the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO). The in-band noise floor of a TDC-DPLL is determined by the TDC resolution. Thanks to noise shaping techniques with oversampling and a pipelined architecture, noise performance can be improved. However, significant area and power must be spent to meet noise requirements. A bang-bang-based digital PLL (BB-DPLL), as the alternative type of DPLL has advantages in terms of area and power over a TDC-DPLL. However, its non-linear operation implies a longer lock time, limit-cycle noise, and high sensitivity to DCO noise. In addition, the in-band noise floor of a BB-DPLL is dominated by the input-tracking jitter, which mainly arises from the DCO noise. This paper presents a BB-DPLL in 14nm FinFET technology, combining a feed-forward delay-locked part (FFDLP) and phase-locked part (PLP) to mitigate aforementioned weaknesses.",

Most TDC research in the past focused on the arrival time difference between the edges of the divider feedback and the reference signal [1-2]. This results in coarser TDC resolution and worse ADPLL noise performance. This paper presents a fractional-/VADPLL that employs a new time-to-digital conversion technique based on sub-sampling phase detection. It is accomplished by directly sampling the analog voltage signal at the PLL's high frequency node and converting it into a digital code. This achieves a higher time resolution with less power.",

Papers in this session include high-performance continuous-time delta-sigma ADCs, a PVT-insensitive TDC implemented in 14nm FinFET technology, and new buffering techniques for both reference voltages and input signals.

However, in practice the quantization noise leakage associated with the mismatch between analog and digital transfer functions degrades performance significantly. The discrete-time (DT) Sturdy-MASH (SMASH) architecture avoids this problem, and promises a higher performance potential [1]. Although straightforward in DT implementation, the SMASH architecture poses challenges in continuous-time (CT) implementation demanded by high-bandwidth applications. This paper presents a 3-1 CT MASH A2 modulator to address these challenges. The modulator is clocked at 1.8GHz and achieves 85dB DR, 85.2dBc SFDR, and 74.6dB SNDR at a 50MHz BW.",

To achieve high resolution (DR>90dB) and low power dissipation (FoMs>170dB), architecture selection and circuit techniques are the main design issues. In [1], a CT \u0394\u03a3 modulator embedded with a 2nd-order active filter and VGA is reported to extend the DR. However, the additional active filter results in a complicated architecture as well as extra area that is not preferred in advanced processes. An alternative method that improves the DR is to adopt the self-coupled noise-injection technique introduced in [2] to increase by one the order of the noise transfer function (NTF). Unfortunately, it requires an accurate clock cycle delay, which is only available in the DT \u0394\u03a3 modulator. Apart from DR considerations, power efficiency is still limited by the building block design. Conventional excess loop delay (ELD) compensation [1,3,4] is implemented by an inner DAC, which increases the power consumption and loads the last integrator with a large parasitic capacitance, especially for a multi-bit modulator. Therefore, a high-bandwidth opamp is required in the last integrator to alleviate the phase delay of the loop filter. Furthermore, to address the nonlinearity of a multi-bit DAC, 2nd-order dynamic element matching (DEM) is used in [5] to reduce data-dependent switching. The SFDR is still limited to 90dB. In this paper, CT self-coupling (CTSC), residual ELD compensation, and DAC linearity enhancement techniques are introduced to overcome these challenges. Our CT \u0394\u03a3 modulator achieves an SNDR of 90.4dB with an FoMs (SNDR) of 177.3dB in a 2.2MHz bandwidth.",

        "abstract": "Out-of-band noise (OBN) is troublesome in analog circuits that process the output of a noise-shaping audio DAC. It causes slewing in amplifiers and aliasing in sampling circuits like ADCs and class-D amplifiers. Nonlinearity in these circuits also causes cross-modulation of the OBN into the audio band. These mechanisms lead to a higher noise level and more distortion in the audio band. OBN also leads to interference in the LF and MF band, compromising e.g. AM radio reception. To avoid these problems, it is desired to reduce OBN power to below -60dBFS. An active low-pass filter after the DAC output can reduce the OBN power to acceptable levels, but this solution is expensive in terms of power consumption and chip area. A FIR-DAC approach implements a 1b PWM modulator, followed by a semi-digital low-pass FIR reconstruction filter. It achieves high-end audio performance with sufficiently low OBN, but the FIR structure costs area, adds latency, and (like an analog low-pass filter) inherently limits the maximum output signal frequency. Multi-bit noise shapers employ smaller quantization steps and therefore output lower OBN. A cascaded-modulator architecture can directly be followed by an on-chip amplifier without low-pass filtering. However, with only 330 quantization levels, it still cannot achieve the desired -60dBFS OBN without additional filtering. Moreover, this approach requires complex dynamic-element matching (DEM) and inter-symbol interference (ISI) shaping mechanisms. The paper present an approach that reduces OBN to below -60dBFS with minimal increase in power and area consumption. It consists of two paths . The main path is based on the work of van Tuijl et al. (2004), containing a 128\u00d7 oversampled 5b 3rd-order noise shaper, thermometer decoder and real-time DEM algorithm followed by a current DAC. Since the digital noise shaper generates negligible in-band noise products, the error signal of the noise shaper is practically equal to the OBN. This error signal is integrated (as part of the loop filter), quantized and fed to a correction path with a differentiating DAC (DIFF-DAC). This DAC inverts the integration action, obtaining unity signal transfer. The output currents of both paths are subtracted, reducing OBN significantly. Quantization noise of the correction path is shaped because the error signal is differentiated after quantization. Depending on the shape of the noise transfer function of the main DAC, the DIFF-DAC needs an over-range in order to accommodate the increased signal swing caused by the integration action. Still, area and power cost is minimal because the range of the DIFF-DAC is still only a fraction of the main DAC range.",

State-of-art SAR ADCs can accomplish this goal with high power-efficiency (<;10fJ/conversion-step) [1-4]. The reference voltage design is critical for the ADC performance to obtain good PSRR, low line-sensitivity and a stable supply-independent full-scale range. However, solutions for efficient reference voltage generators (RVGs) are typically ignored in low-power ADC publications. In reality, due to the low power supply (usually sub-1 V) and limited available power (nW-range), the RVG is a challenge within the sensor system. In this work, a 2.4fJ/conversion-step SAR ADC with integrated reference is implemented. The 0.62V CMOS RVG consumes 25nW. To further reduce RVG power, it can be duty-cycled down to 10% with no loss in ADC performance. Additionally, the ADC uses a bidirectional dynamic comparator to improve the power efficiency even more.",

Their performance, however, is limited by delay variation and random mismatch among delay cells, unless additional error correction or external control are applied. A time-domain successive-approximation scheme could be an option to achieve high resolution but it consumes too much power and area to generate precisely tuned delay cells. In another case, time-amplifier-based multi-step TDCs that can alleviate the requirement on the minimum unit delay of the quantization by time-difference amplification, may be an attractive option. However these tend to be power-hungry or to require additional calibration circuitries due to the inaccuracy and PVT vulnerability of the time amplifier or time register. In this paper, we present a simple, low-power, and PVT-variation-tolerant TDC architecture without any calibration, using stochastic phase interpolation and 16\u00d7 spatial redundancy.",

        "abstract": "High-performance op-amps in a switched-capacitor pipelined ADC consume high power to meet accuracy and speed requirements. This is aggravated by the decrease in intrinsic transistor gain and voltage headroom in nanoscale CMOS. Developments in pipelined ADCs have taken many unique directions to address these issues. Digital calibration of nonlinearity has enabled the use of low-performance op-amps. Non-op-amp-based approaches, such as zero-crossing-based circuits (ZCBC), the pulsed bucket brigade (PBB), and the ring amplifier (RA), have also been explored. This work presents a virtual ground reference buffer approach to significantly relax key op-amp specifications including unity-gain bandwidth, noise, and open-loop gain. Since the op-amp is allowed to settle fully, calibration to remove charge-transfer error in PBB and low gain or non-settling op-amp-based circuits is unnecessary. Also the transient current and corresponding voltage drop across switches and reference buffers in the ZCBCs and in non-settling op-amp-based circuits are avoided. The circuit is also shown to achieve higher maximum operating speed than alternative methods.",

Ultra-thin chips are an essential part of HySiF as they allow for analog signal processing or complex digital controllers using well established CMOS technology. However, the effect of mechanical stress on the signal processing circuitry (piezoresistivity) has to be considered during the top-to-bottom design in order to realize stress insensitive analog and digital operation. On the other hand, for sensing mechanical stress on the same substrate, the stress effect needs to be maximized [2], thus leading to conflicting design requirements.",

An example is X-ray imagers, which have been scaling both in dimension and number of sensors, today reaching millions of pixels. However, processing of the sensor data requires interfacing thousands of signals to CMOS ICs, because implementation of complex functions in LAE has proven unviable due to the low electrical performance and inherent variability of the active devices available, namely amorphous silicon (a-Si) thin-film transistors (TFTs) on glass. Envisioning applications that perform sensing on even greater scales, this work presents an approach whereby high-quality image detection is performed directly in the LAE domain using TFTs. The high variability and number of process defects affecting both the TFTs and sensors are overcome using a machine-learning algorithm known as Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) [1] to form an embedded classifier. Through AdaBoost, we show that high-dimensional sensor data can be reduced to a small number of weak-classifier decisions, which can then be combined in the CMOS domain to generate a strong-classifier decision.",

We employ amorphous Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (a-IGZO) thin-film transistor circuits processed at low temperatures, less than 250C, directly on thin polyester substrates. Reaching NFC standards with a-IGZO circuits is challenging because the technology is n-type only and the electron mobility (~15cm7Vs) is lower compared to silicon. As the main result, we show that the most important NFC regulatory standards are met, even with relaxed 5 micron design rules, using optimized design topologies.",

Previously reported flexible healthcare and biomedicai devices, however, requires wired connection [1,2] or wireless power transmission [3,4]. A flexible energy autonomous healthcare device with a wireless interface, a fever alarm armband (FAA) integrating fully flexible solar cells, a piezoelectric speaker, a temperature detector, and 12V organic complementary FET (CFET) circuits is presented here. The system is also noteworthy for sound generation, with organic circuits driving the speaker.",

        "abstract": "Progress in silicon technology has promoted NEMS sensors as viable and highly sensitive candidates for gravimetric applications such as gas sensing, mass spectrometry and biochemical analysis [1]. The high sensitivity to mass is related to the small dimensions and intrinsic mass of the NEMS themselves, which results in resonant frequencies in the 10MHz-to-1GHz range and drive voltages reaching 1V to 10V. Such a combination of frequencies and voltages is a challenge for the driving electronics. Although several promising approaches using NEMS/CMOS co-integration have been recently published [2], many experiments in the field are currently using discrete electronic boards and specialized lab instruments. To respond to size, power and cost demands, an IC implementing the most critical parts of the full system is described hereafter.",

Among the nanomaterials, carbon nanotube (CNT) is an ideal biosensor material since it has a small diameter (~1nm) directly comparable to the size of biomolecules and excellent electrical characteristics. Because CNT is formed chemically in a special environment, to use it in a CMOS process, many electrodes are formed as an array and the CNT solution is coated on the electrode array. However, to prevent electrical shorts between bonding pads, very complicated area-selective CNT coating processes are required. Furthermore, chip packaging steps - such as wire bonding, chip passivation against reactions to the wire, microfluidic channels on the chip, etc. - should be carefully applied [1].",

        "abstract": "Recently, the demand for miniaturized and fast transient response power delivery systems has been growing in high-voltage industrial electronics applications. Gallium Nitride (GaN) FETs showing a superior figure of merit (Rds, ON X Qg) in comparison with silicon FETs [1] can enable both high-frequency and high-efficiency operation in these applications, thus making power converters smaller, faster and more efficient. However, the lack of GaN-compatible high-speed gate drivers is a major impediment to fully take advantage of GaN FET-based power converters. Conventional high-voltage gate drivers usually exhibit propagation delay, tdelay, of up to several 10s of ns in the level shifter (LS), which becomes a critical problem as the switching frequency, fsw, reaches the 10MHz regime. Moreover, the switching slew rate (SR) of driving GaN FETs needs particular care in order to maintain efficient and reliable operation. Driving power GaN FETs with a fast SR results in large switching voltage spikes, risking breakdown of low-Vgs GaN devices, while slow SR leads to long switching rise time, tR, which degrades efficiency and limits fsw. In [2], large tdelay and long tR in the GaN FET driver limit its fsw to 1MHz. A design reported in [3] improves tR to 1.2ns, thereby enabling fsw up to 10MHz. However, the unregulated switching dead time, tDT, then becomes a major limitation to further reduction of tde!ay. This results in limited fsw and narrower range of VIN-VO conversion ratio. Interleaved multiphase topologies can be the most effective way to increase system fsw. However, each extra phase requires a capacitor for bootstrapped (BST) gate driving which incurs additional cost and complexity of the PCB design. Moreover, the requirements of fsw synchronization and balanced current sharing for high fsw operation in multiphase implementation are challenging.",

With the continuous demand for higher data rates and reduced size, weight, and power consumption, significant research in the past decade has been geared toward integrating high-Q GHz frequency MEMS resonators with standard circuit technologies. This paper presents monolithic integration of GaN MEMS resonators in GaN MMIC technology, which has become mainstream in RF LNA and PA design. Groups at MIT, Michigan and IEMN have previously demonstrated GaN MEMS resonators co-fabricated with HEMTs. This work is the demonstration of a single-chip closed-loop oscillator circuit implementing both passive and active devices in this growing technology platform.",

A new assist technique to drive VMIN reduction and novel bit cells for both 2-port SRAM and TCAM applications are also presented. In addition, two area-efficient techniques to boost DRAM bandwidth are reported.",

        "abstract": "The growth of battery-powered mobile and wearable devices has increased the importance of low-power operation and cost in system-on-a-chip (SoC) design. Supply-voltage scaling is the predominant approach to active power reduction for SoC design, including voltage scaling for on-die memory given increasing levels of memory integration. SRAM can limit the minimum operating voltage (VMIN) of a design, often leading to the introduction of separate voltage supplies for on-die memory. Additional supplies increase platform cost, and operating memory at higher voltage leads to increased power consumption. The introduction of trigate devices at the 22nm technology node delivered superior short channel effects and subthreshold slope relative to existing bulk planar device technology enabling reduction in threshold voltage within a fixed leakage constraint. Lower transistor Vth, improvements to random device variability, and assist circuits to overcome device-size quantization enabled a >150mV reduction in SRAM VMIN [1]. At the 14nm technology node, FinFET device-size quantization remains a challenge for compact 6T SRAM bitcells with minimum-size transistors. Careful co-optimization between technology and design of memory-assist circuits is required in order to deliver dense, low-power memory operation at low voltages. In this paper, we present an 84Mb SRAM array design with wide-voltage-range operation in a 14nm logic technology featuring 2nd-generation FinFET transistors.",

        "abstract": "FinFET technology has been adopted in the 16nm node because it provides superior lon/loff ratio, short-channel effect and local variation [1,2]. 2P-SRAM, which offers simultaneous read and write operations, is widely used for media processing because of its high operating efficiency. However, 2P-SRAM using the conventional 2P8T cell has a read-disturb issue, when both read wordline (RWL) and write word-line (WWL) are asserted simultaneously in the same row [3]. Furthermore, read-disturb becomes worse in FinFET technology compared with classical planar technology. In order to overcome these problems, we develop a disturb-current-free (DCF) 2P8T cell with PMOS write pass-gates and peripheral assist circuits to further improve its performance.",

        "abstract": "Intelligent wearable devices and the Internet of things (IoT) require on-chip SRAM macros with (1) compact area to reduce costs; (2) single supply voltage (VDD) and low minimum VDD (VDDmin) to reduce power consumption; and (3) sufficient speed to facilitate real-time computing. 6T SRAM is compact, but suffers write failure and half-select (HS) disturbance in read/write cycles at low VDD. Previous studies have sought to improve the write margin (WM)of SRAMs by (a) lowering the cell-VDD (CVDD) voltage (=VDD-\u0394VcVVD) [1]-[3] (CVDD-D) at the expense of degradation in cell stability (static noise margin, SNM) for CVDD-HS cells; or (b) using negative-bitline (NBL) voltage (=VSS-VNBL) [1,4-6] for cross-point assist at the expense of increased area and power overhead due to the inclusion of pumping capacitors (CNBL). Wordline (WL) voltage under-drive (WLUD, VWL=VDD-VWLUD) is commonly used in 6T SRAMs [2-5] to improve HS/read SNM during read/write cycles; however, this tends to degrade WM and cell read current (ICELL), resulting in slower read/cycle speeds and necessitating an increase in \u0394VCVDD or VNBL (CNBL). The maximum \u0394VCVDD is limited by the hold SNM of CVDD-HS cells. Large CNBL results in large area and power overhead, particularly in macros with wide I/O and small amount of column-multiplexing (Y-mux). Thus, HS-SNM tradeoffs in lCELL and WM have not yet been solved for 6T cells, except by adding additional transistors (i.e., 8T to 10T).",

Whereas the 45 and 32nm designs employ a micro sense amplifier [2] and three-level bitline hierarchy, the design implemented for 22nm utilizes a higher gain sense amplifier and two-level bitline architecture that together provide significant reductions in area, latency, and power. This 22nm design style has been migrated into a 14nm FinFET [3] learning vehicle, complete with an ABIST engine, wordline charge pumps (VPP and VWL), and padcage interface circuitry.",

        "abstract": "Many big-data (BD) processors reduce power consumption by employing ternary content-addressable-memory (TCAM) [1-2] with pre-stored signature patterns as filters to reduce the amount of data sent for processing in the following stage (i.e., wireless transmission). To further reduce standby power, BD-processors commonly use nonvolatile memory (NVM) to back up the signature patterns of SRAM-based TCAM (sTCAM) [3] during power interruptions or frequent-off operations. However, this 2-macro (sTCAM + NVM) scheme suffers long delays and requires considerable energy for wake-up operations, due to the word-by-word serial transfer of data between NVM and TCAM macros. Most of the signature patterns are seldom updated (written); therefore, single-macro nonvolatile TCAM (nvTCAM) can be used for BD-processors to reduce area and facilitate fast/low-power wake-up operations, compared to the 2-macro approach. Previous nvTCAMs were designed using diode-connected 4T2R with STT-MTJ (D4T2R) [4], 2T2R with PCM [5], and 4T2R with ReRAM [2]; however, they suffer the following issues: (1) large cell area (A) and high write energy (Ew) due to the use of two NVM (2R) devices; (2) limited word-length (WDL, /k-bits) caused by small current-ratio (I-ratio= IML-MIS/(K\u00d7IML)) between match-line (ML) mismatch current (IML-MIS) and ML leakage current of k matched cells (k \u00d7 IML-MIS); (3) Long search delays (TSD) and excessive search energy (Es) due to large ML parasitic load (CML) and small I-ratio. ReRAM is promising for nvTCAM due to its low Ew, high resistance-ratio (R-ratio), and multiple-level cell (MLC) capability. To overcome issue (1) to (3), this study develops an MLC-based 3T1R nvTCAM with bi-directional voltage-divider control (BVDC). A 2\u00d764\u00d764b 3T1R nvTCAM macro is fabricated using back-end-of-line (BEOL) ReRAM [6] and a 90nm CMOS process, with 2.27\u00d7 cell size reduction as compared with sTCAM using the same technology and the TSD (=0.96ns) for WDL=64b.",

Consequently, the design of I/O becomes a crucial issue [1]. In the LPDDR interface, a ground-terminated interface is used for a low-noise termination voltage (Vss) and small I/O capacitance (CIO) [2,3]. Even through noise margins and power efficiency are enhanced by ground termination, to compensate channel loss, the I/O is still the most power-hungry block. The pre-emphasized output driver and DFE are widely used to remove ISI and maximize read/write margins. However, multiple-taps in the output driver and the DFE are required to cover the channel loss, and they degrade the power efficiency of the I/O and occupy a large area.",

        "abstract": "As the demand for high-frequency DDR SDRAM increases, duty-cycle correction circuits (DCC) become a key element to widen the data-valid window (tDV). For duty detection in a DCC, analog schemes using charge pumps [1] and digital schemes using DLL locking [2] or time-to-digital converters (TDC) [3] are widely used. However, they require a certain amount of time proportional to duty errors or a high-resolution TDC to resolve quantization errors. For correction, an edge combiner or slew-rate-changing inverter is commonly used in DRAM applications. An edge combiner utilizes 180\u00b0-phase-shifted clocks, which are obtained by DLL locking or TDC code calculation [4-5], to generate both edges, but it has high-frequency limitations due to gate-delay-based short-pulse generation. The slew-rate-changing inverter has trade-offs between range and resolutions or between resolutions and DCC locking time. To achieve both wide range and fast locking, asynchronous binary search for detection and receiver tail-current tuning can be used for correction [6]. In a WCK-based system, duty and phase skew between iclk and qclk are related to the detection range. However, for normal DDR DRAM, this range should be doubled resulting in more area as well as locking time. To resolve problems with locking time, coverage, and resolution, a hybrid DCC is presented in this paper. For precise duty error detection, the phase and DCC locking processes should be separated, because delay updating disturbs duty-error detecting and averaging. In this paper, an all-digital DCC with TDC and an enhanced edge combiner performs fast DCC operation before DLL coarse locking, and a slew-rate-changing DCC optimized for fine resolution compensates quantization errors caused by all-digital operation.",

        "abstract": "Smart eyeglasses or head-mounted displays (HMDs) have been gaining traction as next-generation mainstream wearable devices. However, previous HMD systems [1] have had limited application, primarily due to their lacking a smart user interface (Ul) and user experience (UX). Since HMD systems have a small compact wearable platform, their Ul requires new modalities, rather than a computer mouse or a 2D touch panel. Recent speech-recognition-based Uls require voice input to reveal the user's intention to not only HMD users but also others, which raises privacy concerns in a public space. In addition, prior works [2-3] attempted to support object recognition (OR) or augmented reality (AR) in smart eyeglasses, but consumed considerable power, >381mW, resulting in <;6 hours operation time with a 2100mWh battery.",

        "abstract": "Image recognition technologies have gained prominence in a variety of fields, such as automotive and surveillance, with dedicated image-recognition ICs being developed recently [1-2]. Image recognition ICs for an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) have also been proposed [3]. However, future ADAS applications must support greater numbers of real-time recognition processes simultaneously, with higher detection rates and lower false-positive rates. For instance, adaptive cruise control (ACC), an application of ADAS, comprises many image recognition processes, such as pedestrian detection (PD), vehicle detection (VD), general obstacle detection (GOD), lane detection (LD), traffic light recognition (TLR), and traffic sign recognition (TSR). ACC also requires high detection accuracy to prevent unnecessary braking or acceleration. To satisfy these requirements, we have developed an SoC with two 4-core processor clusters and 14 hard-wired accelerators. It is designed to realize the six recognition processes (PD, VD, GOD, LD, TLR, and TSR) for ACC and automatic high beam (AHB) for headlight control. It achieves 1.9TOPS peak performance in 3.37W. This low power consumption enables the SoC to operate with passive cooling in a high-temperature automotive environment.",

These applications require extremely low power consumption, while maintaining high recognition accuracy - constraints that arise because of the requirement for continuous heavy vision processing under limited battery capacity. Recently, a low-power feature-extraction accelerator operating at near-threshold voltage (NTV) was proposed, however, it did not support the object matching essential for the object recognition [1]. Even state-of-the-art object matching accelerators consume over 10mW, thereby making them unsuitable for an MAV [2, 3]. Therefore, an ultra-low-power high-accuracy recognition processor is necessary, especially for MAVs and IoT devices.",

In many applications, the analysis of interest is inference (e.g., classification), but the sensor signals involved are too complex to model analytically. Machine learning is gaining prominence because it enables data-driven training of classifiers, overcoming the need for analytical models. This work presents: 1) an algorithmic formulation, where feature extraction and classification are combined into a single matrix, reducing the total multiplications needed, and 2) a matrix-multiplying ADC (MMADC) that enables multiplication of input samples by a programmable matrix. Thus, the MMADC combines feature extraction and classification with data conversion, mitigating the need for further computations. Two systems are demonstrated: an ECG-based cardiac-arrhythmia detector and an image-pixel-based gender detector.",

        "abstract": "Compressive sensing (CS) is a promising solution for low-power on-body sensors for 24/7 wireless health monitoring [1]. In such an application, a mobile data aggregator performing real-time signal reconstruction is desired for timely prediction and proactive prevention. However, CS reconstruction requires solving a sparse approximation (SA) problem. Its high computational complexity makes software solvers, consuming 2-50W on CPUs, very energy inefficient for real-time processing. This paper presents a configurable SA engine in a 40nm CMOS technology for energy-efficient mobile data aggregation from compressively sampled biomedicai signals. Using configurable architecture, a 100% utilization of computing resources is achieved. An efficient data-shuffling scheme is implemented to reduce memory leakage by 40%. At the minimum-energy point (MEP), the SA engine achieves a real-time throughput for reconstructing 61-to-237 channels of biomedicai signals simultaneously with <;1% of a mobile device's 2W power budget, which is 76-350\u00d7 more energy-efficient than prior hardware designs.",

        "abstract": "A 4K\u00d72K H.265/HEVC video codec chip is fabricated in a 28nm CMOS process with a core area of 2.16mm2. This LSI chip integrates a dual-standard (H.265 and H.264) video codec and a series of prevalent (VC-1, WMV-7/8/9, VP-6/8, AVS, RM-8/9/10, MPEG-2/4) decoders into a single chip. It contains 3,558K logic gates and 308KB of internal SRAM. Moreover, it simplifies intra/inter-rate-distortion optimization (RDO) processes and reduces external bandwidth via line-store SRAM pool (LSSP) and data-bus translation (DBT) techniques. For smartphone applications, it completes real-time HEVC encoding and decoding with 4096\u00d72160 resolution and 30fps, and consumes 126.73mW (0.5nJ/pixel) of core power dissipation at 0.9V, at 494MHz (encoding) and 350MHz (decoding). 1080HD and 720HD resolutions are reported as well. The chip features are summarized in Fig. 18.6.1.",

        "abstract": "In this work, the authors demonstrate an MMSE-NBLDPC iterative detector-decoder for a 4\u00d74 256-QAM MIMO system to achieve an excellent error rate that improves with iterations, as shown in Fig. 18.7.1. To minimize latency over the iterative loop and improve throughput, the MMSE detector is divided into 4 task-based coarse pipeline stages so that all stages can operate in parallel. Both the number of stages and the stage latency of the detector are minimized, and the long critical paths are interleaved and placed in a slow clock domain to support a high data rate in a cost-effective way. The resulting MMSE detector achieves an 82% higher throughput compared, and almost 3.5\u00d7 the throughput of the latest SD detector. The NBLDPC decoder is implemented using 78 processing nodes to enable fully parallel message passing. Serial Galois field (GF) processing is pipelined using a data forwarding technique to cut the decoding latency by 30% over the latest design. The detector and decoder exchange symbol log-likelihood ratios (LLR) that are efficiently computed based on the L1 distance to the nearest neighbors in the QAM constellation. To lower the power consumption, automatic clock gating is applied to stage boundary and buffer registers to save 53% of the detector power and 61% of the decoder power. The results are demonstrated in a 65nm MMSE-NBLDPC iterative detector-decoder test chip that achieves 1.38Gb/s detection and 1.02Gb/s decoding (5 iterations), consuming 26.5mW and 103mW, respectively.",

This session opens with three papers demonstrating self-interference cancellation techniques in modern receivers and reconfigurability in SDR for carrier aggregation.

This is accomplished by (i) a bank of tunable, reconfigurable 2nd-order high-Q RF bandpass filters in the canceller to emulate the antenna interface isolation (essentially RF frequency-domain equalization), and (ii) a linear N-path Gm-C filter implementation with embedded variable attenuation and phase shifting. For FDD, SIC enhances effective OOB IIP3 and IIP2 to +25-27d Bm and +90d Bm respectively. For SC-FD, SIC eliminates RX gain compression for as high as -8 dBm of peak in-band SI, and enhances effective in-band IIP3 and IIP2 by 22dB and 58 dB.",

        "abstract": "In-band full-duplex (FD) wireless communication, i.e. simultaneous transmission and reception at the same frequency, in the same channel, promises up to 2x spectral efficiency, along with advantages in higher network layers [1]. the main challenge is dealing with strong in-band leakage from the transmitter to the receiver (i.e. self-interference (SI)), as TX powers are typically >100dB stronger than the weakest signal to be received, necessitating TX-RX isolation and SI cancellation. Performing this SI-cancellation solely in the digital domain, if at all possible, would require extremely clean (low-EVM) transmission and a huge dynamic range in the RX and ADC, which is currently not feasible [2]. Cancelling SI entirely in analog is not feasible either, since the SI contains delayed TX components reflected by the environment. Cancelling these requires impractically large amounts of tunable analog delay. Hence, FD-solutions proposed thus far combine SI-rejection at RF, analog BB, digital BB and cross-domain.",

        "abstract": "The demand for increased wireless data throughput in future wireless communication and the lack of available wide contiguous frequency bands inspire the concept of aggregating multiple frequency bands in a Software-Defined Radio (SDR). A major challenge for such an SDR receiver is maintaining a high dynamic range in the presence of various desired and undesired signals spread over a wide frequency range. This paper introduces a receiver architecture that allows the RF front-end to be configured with various filtering profiles depending on signal scenarios while supporting intra-band multichannel carrier aggregation (contiguous and non-contiguous) with only one frequency synthesizer.",

        "abstract": "Mobile data traffic (driven by video over wireless, Internet of Things and machine-to-machine communications) is predicted to grow by several orders of magnitude over the coming decades, leading to severe spectrum deficits (500MHz to 1GHz in the near to long term). In 2012 the US President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST) recommended sharing government spectrum from 2.7GHz to 3.7GHz for public use while advocating that future systems deliver significantly improved spectrum efficiency. Cognitive radio systems with multi-tiered shared spectrum access (MTSSA) are expected to deliver such superior efficiency over existing scheduled-access systems; they have 3 or more device tiers with different access privileges. Lower tiered `smart' devices opportunistically use the underutilized spectrum and need spectrum sensing for incumbent detection and interf\u00e9rer avoidance. Incumbent detection will rely on database lookup or narrowband high-sensitivity sensing. Integrated interf\u00e9rer detectors, on the other hand, need to be fast, wideband and energy efficient while only requiring moderate sensitivity. During designated slot boundaries (10s of us), they quickly detect the presence of a few (3 or so) large interferers over e.g., a 1GHz span (2.7 to 3.7GHz) with a 20MHz RBW (i.e. 50 bins) so that the carrier-aggregating receiver can be reconfigured on a frame (10s of ms) or even slot (100s of us) basis.",

        "abstract": "The research of 60GHz CMOS transceivers has bloomed due to their capability of achieving low-cost multi-Gb/s short-range wireless communications [1]. Considering practical use of the 60GHz CMOS transceivers, longer operation lifetime with high output power is preferred to provide reliable products. Unfortunately, as indicated in [2], the output power capability of the transmitter will gradually degrade due to the hot-carrier-injection (HCI) effects in the standard CMOS transistors at large-signal operation (e.g. power amplifiers). It is because the inherently large voltage swing at the output of the power amplifiers (PAs) is the main source of the HCI damage. Unfortunately, a thick-oxide transistor, a common solution for reliability issues at lower frequencies, cannot be utilized for 60GHz CMOS PA design due to its limited maximum oscillation frequency (fmax).",

Switched-capacitors are becoming a valuable alternative to inductive converters even for large power levels (on the order of several Watts) with high efficiency and extremely fast transient response. The session starts with 5 papers on switched-capacitor converters, ranging from large conversion ratio, large power and Dynamic Voltage Scaling. On the other hand, both battery-powered and battery-less wireless sensing applications can be enabled by harvesting energy from various energy sources. The second part of the session focuses on energy harvesting techniques and in particular on Maximum Power Point Tracking, energy recycling and zero current detection for photovoltaic, electrostatic, and electromagnetic energy sources.",

        "abstract": "Getting from the mains to a few volts to power electronic circuits requires a very large voltage conversion ratio since the rectified US and EU mains have DC levels of 169V and 325V, respectively. Primary converters, such as flyback converters, use the winding ratio of the isolation transformer to achieve large step-down ratios and generate bus voltages of about 12V. The higher the bus voltage, the higher the efficiency of the primary converter can be and the lower the bus impedance loss. This motivates the investigation of highly efficient DC-DC converters with high voltage conversion ratios (VCRs) to use as secondary converters in AC-DC applications.",

        "abstract": "On-chip (or fully integrated) switched-capacitor (SC) voltage regulators (SCVR) have recently received a lot of attention due to their ease of monolithic integration. The use of deep trench capacitors can lead to SCVR implementations that simultaneously achieve high efficiency, high power density, and fast response time. For the application of granular power distribution of many-core microprocessor systems, the on-chip SCVR must maintain an output voltage above a certain minimum level Uout, min in order for the microprocessor core to meet setup time requirements. Following a transient load change, the output voltage typically exhibits a droop due to parasitic inductances and resistances in the power distribution network. Therefore, the steady-state output voltage is kept high enough to ensure VOUT >Vout, min at all times, thereby introducing an output voltage overhead that leads to increased system power consumption. The output voltage droop can be reduced by implementing fast regulation and a sufficient amount of on-chip decoupling capacitance. However, a large amount of on-chip decoupling capacitance is needed to significantly reduce the droop, and it becomes impractical to implement owing to the large chip area overhead required. This paper presents a feedforward control scheme that significantly reduces the output voltage droop in the presence of a large input voltage droop following a transient event. This in turn reduces the required output voltage overhead and may lead to significant overall system power savings.",

        "abstract": "Inspired by The Square of Vatican City, a fully integrated step-down switched-capacitor DC-DC converter ring with 100+ phases is designed with a fast dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) feature for the microprocessor in portable or wearable devices. As shown in Fig. 20.4.1, this symmetrical ring-shaped converter surrounds its load in the square and supplies the on-chip power grid, such that a good quality power supply can be easily accessed at any point of the chip edges. There are 30 phases on the top edge and 31 phases on each of the other 3 edges, making 123 phases in total. The phase number and unit cell dimensions of this architecture can easily be adjusted to fit the floor plan of the load. The pads of the converter-ring are placed at the corners, and will not affect the pads of the load. Moreover, by using the proposed VDD-controlled oscillator (VDDCO), the frequency of which is controlled by varying its supply voltage, a hitherto unexplored feature of the multiphase DC-DC architecture is exposed: the control-loop unity gain frequency (UGF) could be designed to be higher than the switching frequency.",

        "abstract": "Reducing the supply voltage of digital circuits to the sub- or near-threshold regions minimizes dynamic power consumption and achieves better efficiency [1]. This technique is widely used in energy-efficient applications, and is especially beneficial for wirelessly powered devices such as wearable electronics, biomedicai implants and smart sensor networks. Such devices have long standby times and battery-less operation is highly desirable. As shown in Fig. 20.5.1, for a typical wireless power transmission system, there is a gap between the rectified VIN (>2V) and the low supply voltage VOUT (<;700mV) for powering up energy-efficient digital circuits. To bridge this voltage gap without sacrificing compact size, fully integrated power converters with a low voltage conversion ratio (M=Vout/VIN) and high efficiency are needed. However, a low M results in low efficiency for linear regulators and fully integrated buck converters. On the other hand, fully integrated switched-capacitor power converters (SCPCs) are good alternatives that can achieve high efficiency at low M in low power applications [2-5].",

Resistive load matching [1] as well as maximum power point (MPP) AC-DC conversion [2] are highly suitable techniques for enhancing the electrical energy output of an EMH. The presented interface IC (Fig. 20.6.1) enables MPP AC-DC conversion by tracking the optimum conduction angle and by employing a hysteretic input voltage controlled inductive DC-DC boost converter. All control signals are derived from the harvester voltage itself. Thus, no additional sensor, harvester disconnection, or DC-DC converter duty-cycle control are needed. Additionally, the implemented voltage conditioning provides over-voltage protection (OVP) and application voltage regulation (VR).",

        "abstract": "Compared with inductive DC-DC boost converters [1], the charge pump (CP) features no off-chip inductors and is suitable for monolithic low power energy harvesting applications such as Internet of Things (loT) smart nodes. However, the single conversion ratio (CR) CP has a narrow input voltage range. This induces a charge redistribution loss (CRL) and becomes a bottleneck preventing highly efficient energy harvesting [2]. CRL stems from two facts: 1) The operating voltages of energy sources vary with environment, and 2) Different energy sources feature a wide range of output voltages. By tuning the CR as one dimension, reconfigurable CPs can eliminate CRL; however, they need complex control algorithms, lack maximum power point tracking (MPPT) [3], and only provide fractional ratios [4]. Thus, they are not preferable for energy harvesting from various sources.",

        "abstract": "Battery life is a major concern in wireless sensing applications, as it causes a trade-off between system size and power consumption of the electronic circuits connected to it. Even if electronic circuit power consumption is steadily decreasing, the energy density of common energy storage systems is still extremely low in space-constrained applications. In this scenario, energy harvesting is a valuable solution to extend, in theory indefinitely, the autonomy of ubiquitous sensing systems. In particular, vibrational energy harvesters are an excellent solution to power sensors in industrial and automotive applications. This paper presents an electrostatic energy harvester (EEH) interface. Recently, electret-based EEHs have attracted considerable attention because of their capability to generate large powers, even at low accelerations [1]. Unfortunately, these devices are characterized by extremely high internal impedances and their interfacing circuits need to be simultaneously ultra-low-power and capable of working reliably with several tens of Volts applied to the input. To the best of our knowledge, only one solution has been proposed to efficiently interface high-voltage energy harvesters [2]. However, that circuit did not allow fully autonomous battery-less operation and did not work under 25\u03bcW available power.",

        "abstract": "Energy harvesting (EH) can be used in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) since the sensors can be powered by ambient energy in conjunction with rechargeable batteries to achieve near-perpetual operation [1-4]. One common solution is to harvest energy from ambient light through photovoltaic (PV) modules. In such a system, a battery supplements energy when the power provided by the environment is insufficient or when the WSN is active, and stores surplus energy for future use when the WSN is inactive. Accordingly, power management in an EH system involves a balance among the PV module, battery and load. Previous work [1] has implemented an EH system for moving vehicles and portable devices, but it is not suitable for indoor light energy harvesting. Although a single-inductor multi-input multi-output (SIMIMO) topology is one solution, the efficiencies of existing implementations [2-4] are degraded by additional conduction and switching losses due to the inductor-sharing switches in series with the inductor. In response, this paper proposes an energy-recycling strategy and implements the corresponding power converter with fewer switches.",

        "abstract": "Photovoltaic energy harvesting is an attractive method of developing battery-free systems for wireless sensors, biomedicai electronics, and the internet of things (IoT). To obtain an energy-efficient system, low-power digital circuits operating in the near/sub-threshold region are widely used in such applications. Therefore, the design of a low-voltage buck converter, which converts the harvested energy to the regulated output is critical. Sub-1V buck converters have been implemented using a large inductor [1] to operate in a continuous conduction mode (CCM). Both CCM and discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) operation has been demonstrated in [2], using an analog zero current detection (ZCD) technique to extend the available output power range. However, the analog circuit limits the minimum output power to 50\u03bcW, and reduces the conversion efficiency under light load conditions.",

Body channel communication (BCC), which uses the human body as the communication channel [1], has demonstrated better human-friendly interface and energy-efficient performance compared with air channel communication. However, most of the previous BCC research used only the frequency band below 100MHz and were only focused on either low data rate (<;10Mb/s) healthcare applications [2-5] or high data rate (60Mb/s) multimedia data transfer [6]. Its available channel bandwidth was limited <; 100MHz and the interference from FM radio due to body antenna effect had a significant effect on its performance. Moreover, [6] did not support full duplex communication so that the user interaction with wearable devices was not possible in live video streaming or real-time VR game applications.",

        "abstract": "Signal acquisition systems for emerging applications, such as impiantatile or unobtrusively wearable autonomous sensors, large sensor arrays, or wireless self-powered sensors, require a minuscule form factor and very low power consumption. For example, the power available from a state-of-the-art 1mm3 solid-state thin-film battery is limited to 4nWfora 10yr lifetime [1], and a 1mm3 energy harvester attached to a running person delivers only 7.4nW [2]. While several low-power signal acquisition systems have been proposed [3-5], their consumption is still in the 20-to-1000nW range. Circuits aiming at low absolute power often result in low power-efficiency (due to overhead), high PVT sensitivity and poor reliability (due to the use of simplistic circuitry). This work presents a fully-integrated signal acquisition IC with six-fold lower power consumption than prior art, which provides state-of-the-art power-efficiency and ensures enough circuit reliability, precision and bandwidth to enable practical applications.",

Previous SoCs achieve good integration and even energy harvesting [1][2][3], but they limit supported applications, need higher end-to-end harvesting efficiency, and require duty-cycling for RF communication. This paper demonstrates a highly integrated, flexible SoC platform that supports multiple sensing modalities, extracts information from data flexibly across applications, harvests and delivers power efficiently, and communicates wirelessly.",

Despite its potential as a label-free, nondestructive, real-time and fully electrical monitoring modality for myriad applications, including structural biology, fermentation monitoring for alcoholic beverages, food safety control and clinical diagnostics, DS is still underutilized as an analytic tool in scientific research or clinical settings. This is due to the dearth of an autonomous, small-sized, low-power and portable instrument to conduct MHz-to-GHz DS measurements without requiring a microwave probe station, benchtop vector network analyzer (VNA) equipment, or large (100's of ml) sample volume.",

According to studies showing that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from human breath gas can provide biomarkers for human disease, especially for lung cancer, a non-invasive method was developed to measure the exhaled air from cancer patients using chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, traditional GC-MS equipment is very expensive and requires specialists to operate. In this research we demonstrate a portable micro gas chromatography (\u03bcGC) system to overcome the limitations of conventional methods and realize small chips for big data.",

        "abstract": "Rapid blood test is essential to disease control, risk assessment and point-of-care testing. Conventional enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) requires several hours or even days to get meaningful results. However, to some fierce contagious diseases, such as Ebola and SARS, the contagion can spread so fast that an instant and massive screening test is needed. A CMOS assay system-on-chip (SoC) offering a fast and cheap disease screening tool can be very helpful in the place where the medical resources are limited and the test is too costly to afford. Unlike the previously proposed CMOS biomolecular detection based on direct detection [1], a sandwiched assay detection protocol is adopted in this work, which possesses high sensitivity, high specificity and is free from pre-purified antigen process. As shown in Figure 1, a human blood sample containing the target biomolecules is applied on the proposed SoC. The test procedure includes blood filtration, biomolecular conjugation, electrolytic pumping, magnetic flushing and detection, automatically controlled by a micro-controller unit (MCU). The biomolecular signal is converted to the electrical signal by a CMOS-based Hall sensor array, as shown in the SEM image of Fig. 21.6.1, where the surface is coated with biomolecular probe. With the integration of the four LEDs and a battery, the detection steps can be indicated, providing an easy self-test point-of-care application.",

It was reported that mental activities cause neural, vascular and autonomie domain changes in the human brain [2]. However, the previous neurofeedback system [1] used only neural domain information with low spatial resolution (\u223c10cm) EEG signals. Furthermore, EEG signals are easily interfered by tES stimulation signal, eye-blinking and EMG signals so that it is difficult to monitor in real-time during stimulation and to avoid electromagnetic noise for accurate mental health classification.",

Data center scale computing demands interconnect solutions that support very high data-rates with ultra-low-power consumption at distances of 10m and greater. Because electrical links cannot meet the distance and density targets demanded by this application, demand for innovations in low-cost optical links to enable high-data-rate power-efficient solutions is strong. This session's nine papers highlight advances in hybrid integrated silicon photonics and electronics supporting rates of 25Gb/s and beyond, report a complete link for WDM, and present enhanced opto-electronic building blocks. The remaining papers describe high-voltage/high-speed drivers for ring and MZM modulators, low-power optical receivers, and clocking techniques for parallel optical links.",

Existing optical switch technologies (e.g., MEMS-based) are limited to millisecond-scale reconfiguration times, severely reducing their application space. The emerging field of silicon photonics enables optical switches operating on a nanosecond scale [1]. However, full utilization of the speed of these switches requires nanosecond-scale burst-mode transceivers, similar to those used in passive optical networks [2]. In this work, we reporta burst-mode receiver for optical links in a dynamically reconfigurable network. Through the introduction of interlocking search algorithms, a robust 25Gb/s burst-mode operation is achieved with 31ns lock time, \u221210.9dBm sensitivity, and 4.4pJ/b efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Integrated photonic interconnect technology is free from the bandwidth-distance limitation that intrinsically exists in electrical interconnects, promising a disruptive alternative for next-generation scalable data centers. Silicon photonic platforms have been reported based on monolithic and hybrid integration. Monolithic systems mitigate integration overhead but require compromise in either electronic or photonic device performance [1,2]. Hybrid integration allows for independent process selection for each device so that overall system can potentially achieve the best performance [3]. This paper presents a hybrid integrated electrical-optical (E-O) interface including a driver/TIA chip in 28nm CMOS and a modulator/PD chip in SOI, based on a mixed-pitch bumping technology. A pseudo-differential driver with pre-emphasis enables an 800MHz bandwidth (BW) carrier-injection ring modulator to operate at 25Gb/s with power efficiency of 2.9pJ/b. A TIA implements two BW-enhancement techniques: a regulated-cascode (RGC) input stage with shunt-shunt feedback and T-coil inductive peaking, and a hybrid offset calibration, achieving 25Gb/s with power efficiency of 2.0pJ/b and a sensitivity of -8.0dBm OMA.",

        "abstract": "Modern SoC systems impose stringent requirements on on-chip clock generation and distribution. Ring-oscillator (RO) based injection-locked (IL) clocking has been used in the past to provide a low-power, low-area and low-jitter solution. Ring-based injection-locked oscillators (ILO) can also be used to generate quadrature phases from a reference clock without frequency division, which is desirable for half-rate and quarter-rate CDR. However, ILO inherently has a small locking range making it less suitable for wideband applications. In addition, drift in the free-running frequency due to PVT variations may lead to poor jitter performance and locking failures. Adding a PLL to an ILO provides frequency tracking. However, PLL-aided techniques have second-order characteristics that lead to jitter peaking. They also add design complexity and power consumption . We present a frequency-tracking method that exploits the dynamics of IL in a quadrature RO to increase the effective locking range. This quadrature locked loop (QLL) is used to generate accurate clock phases for a 4-channel optical receiver using a forwarded clock at quarter-rate. The QLL drives an ILO at each channel without any repeaters for local quadrature clock generation. Each local ILO has deskew capability for phase alignment. The receiver maintains per-bit energy consumption across wide data-rates (16 to 32Gb/s) by adaptive body biasing (BB) in a 28nm FDSOI technology.",

While CMOS optical front-ends have been previously developed that support data-rates in excess of 20Gb/s, these designs often do not offer the retiming and deserialization functions required to form a complete link [1,4]. Furthermore, along with the requirements of a sensitive energy-efficient receiver front-end with low-complexity clocking, wavelength stabilization control is necessary to compensate for the fabrication tolerances and thermal sensitivity of microring drop filters. In this work, a 24Gb/s hybrid-integrated microring receiver is demonstrated the incorporates the following key advances: 1) a low-complexity optically-clocked source-synchronous receiver with LC injection-locked oscillator (ILO) jitter filtering; 2) a large input-stage feedback resistor TIA cascaded with an adaptively-tuned continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) for improved sensitivity and bandwidth; 3) a receive-side thermal tuning loop that stabilizes the microring drop filter resonance wavelength with minimal impact on receiver sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Silicon photonics (SiPh) has been identified as a prime technology targeting cost-effective short-range optical links [1]. Wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is an attractive approach for enabling high aggregate transceiver bandwidth without increasing the number of optical fibers used in the link. Ring-based optical modulators and wavelength-selective filters are attractive devices for scalable WDM SiPh transceivers owing to their compact footprint and moderate power required for thermal tuning. In this paper, we report on a thermally controlled ring-based flip-chip integrated CMOS-SiPh transceiver with 4 channels operating at 20Gb/s.",

        "abstract": "Silicon photonic microring modulators (MRMs) offer a promising approach for realizing energy-efficient wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) optical interconnects. For data-rates greater than 10Gb/s, depletion-mode MRMs are generally preferred over their injection-mode counterparts due to their shorter carrier lifetimes and resulting higher bandwidths. Unfortunately, these depletion-mode MRMs typically exhibit low PN junction tunability, thereby requiring higher modulation voltages in order to provide >6dB extinction ratios (ER). Furthermore, negative DC-biasing of the MRMs is necessary to maintain reverse-biased depletion-mode operation. In this work, a 5\u00d725Gb/s hybrid-integrated MRM WDM transmitter is demonstrated that incorporates the following key advances: 1) an AC-coupled differential output driver that applies a 4.4Vpp-diff output-swing on the MRM while providing a tunable on-chip negative DC-bias; 2) a 2-tap non-linear digital FFE that compensates for optical-dynamics-induced bandwidth limitations; 3) a dynamic thermal tuning loop that stabilizes the MRM by minimizing thermally-induced wavelength fluctuations.",

        "abstract": "To meet increasing demands for server computational power, high-density, multilane links with a data rate exceeding 25Gb/s/lane are needed. An optical transceiver with a retiming capability would significantly enhance the usability of the link by extending the reach. Such optical transceivers should operate without an external clock source since a small form factor is imperative. The optical link we develop has a four-lane configuration that consists of an electrical-to-optical (E/O) converter and an optical-to-electrical (O/E) convertor (Fig. 22.7.1). Both the E/O and O/E convertors are equipped with a per-lane reference-less clock-and-data recovery (CDR) circuit that enables independent operation of each lane. The transceiver pitch is 250\u03bcm/lane, which matches the fiber pitch of the optical-fiber array used in the link. Since the jitter added by the CDR should be minimized in retimer applications, an LC-VCO is a preferable choice for clock-signal generation. At this transceiver pitch, however, the coupling through mutual inductances between LC tanks has a significant impact on the CDR characteristics. To address this concern, we analyze the impact of inter-VCO coupling and design the CDR so that the coupling does not affect the CDR performance. Each lane of the E/O convertor consists of a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE), a CDR, and a VCSEL driver with a two-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE) (Fig. 22.7.1). Each lane of the O/E convertor has a trans-impedance amplifier (TIA) stage followed by a limiting amplifier (LA), a CDR, and an electrical-line driver with a two-tap FFE. All the CDRs have an identical design consisting of a flip-flop for the data decision, a selector for bypass-mode operation, a Pottbacker type phase-frequency detector (PFD) [1], a charge pump (CP), a lag-lead filter, and a quadrature LC-VCO (QVCO). During the bypass mode, the CDR loop is set into a power-down mode where the VCO does not oscillate.",

        "abstract": "The optical interconnect technologies are a promising solution for high-speed and high-density interconnects because of the high-bandwidth and low-crosstalk properties of optical signals. The next challenge for optical interconnects is to move to a serial data-rate of 25Gb/s or higher [1,2]. To achieve flexible interconnects on a bandwidth demand, a CDR is required to operate at multiple rates in a wide tuning range. A selectable multi-VCO structure is one method to overcome this issue. However, when multi-VCOs are allocated in each channel, the large size of VCOs makes it difficult to achieve a high-density optical link. In this paper, we presenta dual-loop hybrid CDR including a phase interpolator (PI) loop for phase tracking and a common VCO loop situated outside the channel areas for frequency acquisition. We develop a quadrant-switching analog Pl-loop that has the ability to track the frequency mismatch corresponding to full-rate frequency up to 35Gb/s. The 4-channel driver IC with this dual-loop hybrid CDR is fabricated in 0.13\u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS technology. With these circuits, we achieve a driver IC with a multi-rate, ranging from 24 to 35Gb/s, reference-less CDR for flexible optical interconnects.",

        "abstract": "Data centers and high-performance computing markets are growing at a fast pace, mandating power-efficient and cost-effective high-speed interconnects [1], tackling the large attenuation and crosstalk problems of metal interconnects and allowing higher miniaturization than hybrid photonics. The emerging silicon photonics technology lends itself to low cost short- and medium-reach optical communications. Externally modulated lasers allow transmitted optical signals with higher spectral purity than directly modulated lasers [2]. Discarding electro-absorption modulators (EAMs), which imply difficult hybrid integration of III-V materials on silicon, external modulation can be realized in silicon photonics by adopting Mach-Zehnder modulators (MZMs). A dual-drive push-pull configuration allows achieving optimal chirp performance [2], reducing dispersion in the fiber. Compared to ring resonator modulators, MZMs can operate over a much wider optical bandwidth without requiring device tuning. In particular, MZMs are almost insensitive to temperature variation and thus do not require power-hungry thermal controllers [3], which can significantly increase the overall power consumption of electro-optical transmitters.",

Furthermore, mobile GPU performance is becoming increasingly important as mobile game graphics requirements are pushing the limits of GPU capabilities. For an enhanced mobile game user experience, a multi-core GPU is required. CPU/GPU power efficiency for longer battery life has been a major interest to consumers for many years. In order to support higher performance and power efficiency, two 64b quad-core CPUs with different microarchitectures and a hexa-core GPU are implemented using Samsung's 20nm gate-last high-k/metal-gate (HKMG) process.",

        "abstract": "Depth information has become essential in emerging computer vision applications. Although active sensing methods can provide an accurate indoor depth map, they have limited resolution and consume significant power, such as the 2.1W time-of-flight sensor in [1]. In contrast, depth estimation for stereo RGB images can provide high-resolution depth maps, even in outdoor or low-power scenarios. And, the depth accuracy can be increased by using multi-view light-field images. This paper presents an integrated circuit which estimates full HD (1920\u00d71080) depth maps at 30fps and provides a tradeoff between depth accuracy and power consumption based on two-/three-/five-view stereo images. It addresses design challenges with three primary contributions: 1) a stripe buffering scheme which is designed to reduce the DRAM bandwidth induced by multi-view image access; 2) a four-bank interleaving architecture, which boosts computation performance by parallelizing belief-propagation (BP) operations; and, 3) an adaptive view selection unit, which realizes the accuracy-power tradeoff.",

In this session we address the security and efficiency issues that must be addressed before IoT devices can be deployed in a ubiquitous manner. IoT devices require advanced security mechanisms that protect the private data contained within them from cryptanaiytic and physical attacks. This session includes four papers that present demonstrations of security, power and context-aware voice-activated circuitry, an emerging computing paradigm inspired by magnetic spin interactions, and a low power, low cost backplane interconnect.",

        "abstract": "Implementing cryptography and security into integrated circuits is somehow similar to applications in other fields. We have to worry about comparable optimization goals: area, power, energy, throughput and/or latency. Moore's law helps to attain these goals. However, it also gives the attackers more computational power to break cryptographic algorithms. On top of this, quantum computers may become soon a reality, so that novel, very computationally demanding \"post-quantum\" cryptographic algorithms need implementation. Finally, there is a third dimension to the problem: implementations have to be resistant against physical attacks and countermeasures increase the cost. This paper demonstrates with actual data how these conflicting challenges are being addressed.",

        "abstract": "The rise of always-listening sensors integrated in energy-scarce devices such as watches and remote-controls increases the need for intelligent scalable interfaces. Contemporary sensor interfaces digitize raw sensor data to extract information with energy-intensive computations, such as FFT, which is inefficient if the end goal is to only extract selective information for classification tasks, e.g. voice activity detection (VAD). Previous work shows energy gains from early data reduction through analog feature extraction [1] or embedded classification hardware [2]. However, the potential energy savings of these devices is limited as they cannot adapt to changes in the sensed information content or sensing context, such as the amount/type of acoustic background noise. In the processor design community, such adaptivity to varying operating conditions is actively researched through the concept of hierarchical computing [3]. This work integrates the concept of hierarchical operation with adaptive early data extraction and classification, towards a power- and context-aware information-extraction sensor interface. This paper specifically reports on a \u03bcW 90nm CMOS VAD, that dynamically adapts sensing resources to signal information content and context, thus only spending energy on relevant information extraction. An order of magnitude in power savings is achieved by exploiting hierarchical sensing, run-time activated/scalable analog feature extraction and tightly-integrated context-aware mixed-signal machine learning inference, enabling novel applications in area of acoustic sensing [1,4].",

        "abstract": "In the near future, the performance growth of Neumann-architecture computers will slow down due to the end of semiconductor scaling. Presently a new computing paradigm, so-called natural computing, which maps problems to physical models and solves the problem by its own convergence property, is expected. The analog computer using superconductivity from D-Wave [1] is one of those computers. A neuron chip [2] is also one of them. We proposed a CMOS-type Ising computer [3]. The Ising computer maps problems to an Ising model, a model to express the behavior of magnetic spins (the upper left diagram in Fig. 24.3.1), and solves the problems by ground-state search operations. The energy of the system is expressed by the formula in the diagram. Computing flows are expressed in the lower flow chart in Fig. 24.3.1. In the conventional Neumann architecture, the problem is sequentially and repeatedly calculated, and therefore, the number of computing steps drastically increases as the problem size grows. In the Ising computer, in the first step, the problem is mapped to the Ising model. In the next steps, an annealing operation, the ground-state search by interactions between spins, are activated and the state transitions to the ground state where the energy of the system is minimized. The interacting operation between spins is decided by the interaction coefficients, which are set to each connection. Here, the configuration of the interaction coefficients is decided by the problem, and therefore, the interaction coefficients are equivalent to the programming in the conventional computing paradigm. The ground state corresponds to the solution of the original problem, and the solution is acquired by observing the ground state. The interactions for the annealing are performed in parallel, and the necessary steps for the annealing are smaller than that used by a sequential computing, Neumann architecture. As the table in Fig. 24.3.1, our Ising computer uses CMOS circuits to express the Ising model, and acquires the scalability and operation at room temperature.",

        "abstract": "Processor systems that are mounted in satellites must be small and light, having high data transfer rates, and high storage capacity [1]. A small reduction in size and weight could reduce the cost of launching a satellite by a significant amount. The next generation of earth observation satellites will require data transmission rates to a maximum of 20Gb/s and at least one terabyte of storage capacity. The volume, weight, and communication speed of the processor system is determined by the backplane connectors (Fig. 20.4.1). It is difficult to achieve a connector that can pass signals of 2.5Gb/s or more. The signal reflection that occurs when signals are branched at connectors and at the wire stubs of branches decreases the transmission speed, so only point-to-point connections are possible. Once the satellite is launched, repair or replacement is not possible, and system redundancy is introduced. Accordingly, 512 backplane wires would be required. The signal connector would require 1,024pins, including the ground pins used to prevent crosstalk, and would be 512mm wide, which is even wider than the circuit board of each module.",

        "abstract": "Frequency generation circuits are ubiquitous building blocks in communication, sensing, and imaging systems. This session covers the latest advances in frequency generation, targetting reduction of noise, chip area, and power consumption in frequency synthesizers and VCOs. The session includes an E-band phase-locked-based frequency synthesizer that employs passive scaling to increase loop-filter capacitance, a phase-locked-based transmission array at 320GHz frequency, and a highly stable thin-film-based acoustic resonator achieving a stability of \u00b13 ppm from 0 to 90\u00b0C. Two papers describe techniques for reducing the effects of flicker noise in oscillators, another describes quantization noise cancellation in a fractional-N PLL, and another reduces PLL noise by manipulating impulse sensitivity and noise modulating functions of transistors. One paper addresses all-digital PLL design using voltage-mode digitization, and another describes inductorless PLL design to reduce power consumption.",

        "abstract": "Digital fractional-N PLLs are increasingly used in place of analog fractional-N PLLs as frequency synthesizers in wireless applications, because they avoid large analog loop filters and can tolerate device leakage and low supply voltages, which makes them better-suited to highly-scaled CMOS technology [1-6]. However, the phase noise and spurious tone performance of previously published digital PLLs is inferior to that of the best analog PLLs. This is because all fractional-N PLLs introduce quantization noise, and in prior digital PLLs this noise has higher power or spurious tones than in comparable analog PLLs. Digital PLLs based on \u0394\u03a3 frequency-to-digital conversion (FDC-PLLs) offer a potential solution to this problem in that their quantization noise ideally is equivalent to that of analog PLLs, but prior FDC-PLLs incorporate charge pumps and ADCs that have so far limited their performance and minimum supply voltages [7,8]. This paper presents an FDC-PLL that avoids these limitations by implementing the functionality of a charge pump and ADC with a simple dual-mode ring oscillator (DMRO) and digital logic. Also demonstrated is a new quantization noise cancellation (QNC) technique that relaxes the fundamental bandwidth versus quantization noise tradeoff inherent to most fractional-TV PLLs. The new techniques enable state-of-the-art spurious tone performance and very low phase noise with a lower power dissipation and supply voltage than previously published state-of-the-art PLLs in the same class shown in Fig. 25.1.6.",

        "abstract": "CMOS VCO performance metrics have not improved significantly over the last decade. Indeed, the best VCO Figure of Merit (FOM) currently reported was published by Hegazi back in 2001 [1]. That topology, shown in Fig. 25.3.1(a), employs a second resonant tank at the source terminals of the differential pair that is tuned to twice the LO frequency (FLO). The additional tank provides a high common-mode impedance at 2\u00d7FLO, which prevents the differential pair transistors from conducting in triode and thus prevents the degradation of the oscillator's quality factor (Q). As a consequence, the topology can achieve an oscillator noise factor (F)-defined as the ratio of the total oscillator noise to the noise contributed by the tank- of just below 2, which is equal to the fundamental limit of a cross-coupled LC CMOS oscillator [2]. There are, however, a few drawbacks of Hegazi's VCO: (1) the additional area required for the tail inductor, (2) the routing complexity demanded of the tail inductor, which can degrade its Q and limit its effectiveness, and (3) for oscillators with wide tuning ranges, the need to independently tune the second inductor, which again can degrade its Q. Moreover, it can be shown that the common-mode impedance of the main tank at 2\u00d7FLO also has a significant effect on the oscillator's performance, which if not properly modeled can lead to disagreement between simulation and measurement, particularly in terms of the flicker noise corner. To mitigate these issues, this work introduces a new oscillator topology that resonates the common-mode of the circuit at 2\u00d7FLO, but does not require an additional inductor.",

The resulting 1/f3 phase noise (PN) can be an issue in PLLs with a loop bandwidth of <;1MHz, which practically implies all cellular phones. A previously published noise-filtering technique [1] and adding resistors in series with gm-device drains [2] have shown significant reduction of the 1/f3 oscillator PN corner. However, the former needs an additional tunable inductor and the latter degrades PN in the 20dB/dec region.",

        "abstract": "Non-ionizing terahertz imaging using solid-state integrated electronics has been gaining increasing attention over the past few years. However, there are currently several factors that deter the implementations of fully-integrated imaging systems. Due to the lack of low-noise amplification above fmax, the sensitivity of THz pixels on silicon cannot match that of its mm-Wave or light-wave counterparts. This, combined with the focal-plane array configuration adopted by previous sensors, requires exceedingly large power for the illumination sources. Previous works on silicon have demonstrated 1mW radiation [1,3]; but higher power, as well as energy efficiency, are needed for a practical imaging system. In addition, heterodyne imaging scheme was demonstrated to be very effective in enhancing detection sensitivity [4]. Due to the preservation of phase information, it also enables digital beam forming with a small number of receiver units. This however requires phase locking between the THz source and receiver LO with a small frequency offset (IF<;1GHz). In [5], a 300GHz PLL is reported with probed output. In this paper, a 320GHz transmitter using SiGe HBTs is presented (Fig. 25.5.1). Combining 16 coherent radiators, this work achieves 3.3mW radiated power with 0.54% DC-RF efficiency, which are the highest among state-of-the-art silicon THz radiators shown in the comparison table in Fig. 25.5.6. Meanwhile, the output beam is phase-locked by a fully-integrated PLL, which enables high-performance heterodyne imaging systems.",

        "abstract": "To support 16-QAM modulation in E-band applications, phase-locked loops (PLLs) are required to have wide a frequency tuning range from 71 to 86GHz and low phase noise of \u221290dBc/Hz @1MHz [1], which are still very challenging even with aggressive CMOS scaling [2]. Another issue associated with PLLs is the difficulty to integrate on-chip loop filters. Active loop filters are employed to scale down the loop filter capacitors and enable them to be fully integrated on-chip [3]. However, this method suffers from large active noise induced by the op-amp. Moreover, as the capacitance is reduced, the resistor value has to be increased to maintain the same zero frequency, leading to higher thermal noise and limiting achievable scaling factor. Another method is to integrate digital loop filters in all-digital PLLs (ADPLLs) [4]. Unfortunately, the quantization noise of digitally-controlled oscillators (DCOs) becomes a bottleneck to achieve good phase noise due to their limited frequency resolution. Furthermore, E-band DCO oscillation frequency is more sensitive to capacitor variation, making it even more difficult to achieve high frequency resolution. To address these issues, this paper proposes a 70.5-to-85.5GHz PLL with an injection-locked frequency tripler (ILFM3) and passive scaling to increase the effective capacitor for the loop filter by 100 times.",

PN in CMOS VCOs, especially close-in PN, greatly suffers from flicker noise. The flicker noise can even degrade the PN at higher offset frequencies (\u223c1MHz). The close-in PN is important in many communication applications. For instance, IEEE 802.11a/b/g requires a very low PN at 10kHz offset frequency [1] and the PN performance at 100kHz is critical in cellular and Wi-Fi MIMO applications. In addition to the PN performance, oscillators with lower power consumption and smaller area are always on demand.",

        "abstract": "Multiple emerging wireless applications (body-worn devices and IoT, for example) will demand previously impossible thin-film form factors and low system cost. One key enabling technology for this paradigm is a new class of radios that offer cost/size approaching RFID while still maintaining peer-to-peer connectivity like more complex radios. These radios need to be cheap and thin, which means they should be fabricated using wafer-scale semiconductor processing. The existing paradigm (quartz crystals used as a frequency reference in radios) is a huge bottleneck in reducing cost and size of these devices. MEMS frequency references have replaced quartz crystals in some applications [1-3]. For example, [1] reports a MEMS reference with 0.5ppm stability but the power consumption (\u223c100mW) and supply voltage (1.8V) are not suitable for low-voltage/low-power radios. [2] reports a 32kHz, 3ppm reference for mobile time-keeping applications, but is unsuitable for radio frequency synthesis due to its low output frequency. In this paper, we report a thin-Film Bulk-Acoustic-Resonator (FBAR) frequency reference suitable for low-voltage/low-power radio applications. The reported FBAR reference achieves a stability of +/- 3ppm from 0 to 90C. We achieve this by using an electronic temperature compensation scheme to improve the intrinsic +/-50ppm stability of an FBAR oscillator down to +/- 3ppm (Fig. 25.9.1). The core of the temperature compensation scheme is a temperature sensor that achieves a 1.75mK resolution at a 100mS sampling time.",

        "abstract": "The SAR-assisted pipeline ADC is an energy-efficient architecture for high resolution [1]. Consisting of two low-resolution charge-redistribution SARADCs coupled by a residue amplifier, a SAR-assisted pipeline ADC relaxes the noise requirements of the second stage and enhances the overall ADC speed while maintaining excellent power efficiency [1-4]. However, designs reported in [1,2] rely on power-hungry telescopic amplifiers that also limit the available inter-stage residue gain due to low output swing. A lower-power alternative is a dynamic amplifier, which operates as an open-loop time-domain integrator [3,4]. Although time-domain integration provides the benefit of noise filtering, the calibration required to achieve an accurate residue gain increases design complexity and test cost, and limits robustness. We introduce an uncalibrated fully differential ring-amplifier-based 13b 50MS/s rail-to-rail input swing SAR-assisted pipeline ADC with Waiden and Schreier (SNDR) FoMs of 6.9fJ/conversion-step and 174.9dB, respectively. We also present an improved DAC switching technique that further reduces the first DAC energy consumption and also reduces the DAC errors.",

        "abstract": "Wireless standards, e.g., 802.15.4g, need high-resolution ADCs (>10b) with very low power and MS/s sampling rates. The SAR ADC is well known for its excellent power efficiency. However, its intrinsic accuracy (DAC matching) is limited up to 10 to 12b in modern CMOS technologies [1]. Scaling up the device dimensions can improve matching but it deteriorates power-efficiency and speed. Alternatively, calibrations [2-5] are introduced to correct errors (e.g., comparator offset and capacitor mismatch) and push the SNDR beyond 62dB. However, most of the calibrations [2-4] are implemented off-chip and the power for the calibration circuit is relatively high when implemented on-chip. Foreground calibration [4-5] is an alternative but is sensitive to environmental changes. We report a low-power fully automated on-chip background calibration that uses a redundancy-facilitated error-detection-and-correction scheme. Thanks to the low-power calibration, this ADC achieves an ENOB of 10.4b and a power efficiency of 5.5fJ/conv-step at 6.4MS/S.",

        "abstract": "The IEEE 802.3an standard describes full-duplex 10Gb/s Ethernet transmission over four pairs of up to 100m UTP cable. The performance required from the analog front end (AFE) of a 10GBASE-T Ethernet transceiver strongly depends on the length of the cable connected to it. Maximum-length cables require the highest performance, and hence, determine the worst-case power dissipation of the transceiver. In practice, however, the vast majority of cable lengths used are below 30m. For these shorter cables, the standard specifies the transmitted power level to be lowered, inherently leading to a reduction in power consumption of the transmitter (TX). In most designs, the power consumption of the receiver (RX), unfortunately, does not benefit from the shorter cable lengths [1,2]. This paper presents a power-efficient 13b RX, implemented in 28nm CMOS. By switching to a 10b mode for short cables, 143mW is saved in the AFE for one complete Ethernet port, comprising four receivers. In addition, to further reduce power, the RX heavily relies on calibrations.",

        "abstract": "Recently reported high-speed ADCs have mostly taken advantage of time-interleaved (TI) architectures with low-power SAR ADCs for their sub-channels. However, given that the TI architecture needs to satisfy matching requirements between channels, the circuit complexity arising from the calibrations has often become a considerable burden. In order to reduce the number of channels in TI SAR ADCs, a flash-assisted TI (FATI) SAR structure [1] can be utilized to enhance the conversion speed of a sub-channel SAR ADC due to the multi-bit MSBs from a front-end flash ADC. In addition, because the codes from each SAR ADC embed the timing skew information of the corresponding channel, the structure can extract timing skew information in an efficient manner [2]. Despite these advantages of FATI SAR ADCs, as the required conversion rate increases, the power consumption of the front-end flash ADC becomes significant, which reduces the efficiency. In addition, if the target speed is higher than the frequency achievable by a single flash ADC, the FATI SAR ADC should be time-interleaved with multiple flash ADCs. The timing skew calibration scheme reported in [2] cannot be applied in this case. Considering these issues, this work introduces an advanced FATI SAR ADC with a folding-flash (F-flash) ADC that reduces the power burden placed upon a flash ADC. In addition, 2\u00d7 time interleaving is applied in an effort to lower the conversion rate of the flash ADC (time-interleaved FATI SAR ADC). The offset and timing skew of each channel are calibrated in the background.",

Parallel schemes like multi-bit processing and interleaving [1], can ease the problems caused by scaling and lead to better efficiency if the hardware overhead is wisely reduced [2].

        "abstract": "The recent emergence of direct sampling in residential broadband satellite and cable receivers has spurred the need for low-power, high-speed (~5GS/s), mid-resolution (~10b) A/D converters. Recently, time-interleaved (TI) SARs have been a popular choice for low-power, medium-speed, mid-resolution ADCs [1-3]. As the conversion rate and resolution requirements increase, TI-SARs become less attractive in terms of power efficiency and complexity compared to TI-pipelined ADCs [4], where the critical SNR, THD, and TI matching are only required in the MDACs resolving the MSBs. In this paper we report a hybrid of TI-pipelined MDAC and TI-SAR, in which the former resolves the 2 MSB bits and the latter resolves the 8 lower bits. This hybrid architecture combines the advantages from each ADC type to achieve better power at 5GS/s. The front-end is implemented by time-interleaving two 2.5b MDAC slices, easing the timing-matching requirement and complexity. The MDAC stage also eases the timing-matching requirement among the TI-SARs by presenting an amplified-and-held signal to each SAR input. This allows taking advantage of a low-resolution SAR's simplicity and low power, for the last 8b. This work also proposes a SHA-less front-end to further minimize the ADC power. Two simple calibration techniques are introduced on-chip to enable the topology: (a) an over-range calibration (ORcal) loop to correct the sampling-time error between MDAC and sub-ADC in the SHA-less front-end, and (b) SAR reference calibration to align the SAR's full-scale to the MDAC's. Figure 26.6.1 shows the timing and functional block diagram of the 5GS/s hybrid SHA-less ADC. The RF buffer directly drives two TI-slices, each comprising a 2.5GS/S MDAC stage to resolve the 2.5 MSB bits, followed by 4-way interleaved 625MS/S SARs to resolve the lower 8b, for a combined 10b resolution (1b overlap), at 5GS/s.",

        "abstract": "With the growing interest in time-interleaved (TI) structures, the conversion rates of ADCs have greatly improved, which has inevitably increased power consumption. Despite the advantages of TI structures, power consumption is increased due to the stricter matching requirements between channels; in some cases, >50% of total power is for calibration purposes. Thus, to realize high-speed and high-resolution ADCs with TI structures, it is important to alleviate the calibration burden by choosing a suitable number of power-efficient high-speed single channels. Previously reported CDAC-based 2b/cycle structures made contributions in realizing high-speed single-channel ADCs with high resolution by using additional capacitive DACs and modified switching logic. The power overhead and the complexity of the additional logic and DACs for 2b/cycle implementations have been of trivial concern for low resolution ADCs. However, as resolution increases, the complexity of such circuits becomes considerable, with power taking up a big share of the total. In this paper, a multi-step hardware-retirement (MSHR) technique, which disables low-accuracy hardware blocks of scaled sizes with the requirement relaxations from redundancies in an advancement to the reconfiguration scheme in the work of Kong et al. (2013), is reported to alleviate the overhead of additional logic and DACs for ADCs, requiring high resolutions. A low-power 2.6b/cycle-based SAR ADC architecture is presented as a proof of concept.",

Gyroscopes for ESC applications require higher performance specifications than those of consumer gyroscopes available in the market today. In addition, they require continuous safety monitoring so that changes in the output, which happen in the field due to MEMS and circuit malfunctions, are flagged and are not misconstrued for legitimate signals. This work presents a low-overhead approach for implementing accurate continuous safety monitoring by augmenting the function of already existing sub-systems. In addition, the paper discusses circuit architecture and design techniques, which achieve the stringent ESC specifications for noise, robustness to parasitic resonant modes in the sensor element and offset drift due to temperature and Electro-Magnetic Interference (EMI).",

        "abstract": "Inertial navigation sets a very stringent requirement on the long-term stability of an accelerometer, which is characterized by bias instability. Long-term stability demands a very low-noise design. Accelerometers based on capacitance sensing are the mainstream MEMS accelerometers reported recently [1-3]. The state-of-the-art achieves 1\u03bcg bias instability and 2\u03bcg/Hz1/2 resolution with a full scale of \u00b115g [1]. Compared with capacitive accelerometers, a MEMS silicon oscillating accelerometer (SOA) has the advantage of large input dynamic range and has potential to achieve better performance. So far, only a few SOAs with CMOS readout circuits have been reported. Among them, the best performance metrics achieved are 4\u03bcg bias instability and 20\u03bcg/Hz1/2 resolution [4].",

        "abstract": "Consumer-electronic (CE) gyroscopes have recently enjoyed broad deployment in high-volume applications, largely due to intuitive user interfaces in smart phones and video game controllers. For their continued expansion into more demanding CE applications, a further reduction of their noise, offset drift, and power dissipation, especially in the emerging always-on category, is mandatory. To be viable, solutions to these conflicting requirements must overcome the challenges of low cost and ever-shrinking package size. This paper describes one such solution with special emphasis on offset drift reduction. The system presented here discards the standard practice of electrically cancelling the quadrature error, and instead combines information derived from continuously monitoring the quadrature error together with a single-point temperature calibration to reduce offset drift. This paper presents the architecture and circuits used to realize a 3-axis open-loop gyroscope with a one-sigma TCO of 0.0065\u00b0/s/K.",

The dynamic behavior and safety of an automobile tire is closely dependent on its inflation pressure: maintaining the manufacturer-recommended pressure is essential to prevent tire failure, provide stability, improve fuel efficiency and tire-life, and to reduce C02 emissions [1]. Thus, Tire-Pressure Monitoring Systems (TPMS) have become an essential component in modern vehicles, as stipulated by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in 2006. State-of-the-art TPMS systems currently require a pressure sensor, multiple ICs, several external components, and a crystal on a PCB allowing wireless transmission of tire pressure [2] [3]. In this work, we describe a sub-mm3 fully integrated wireless pressure sensor including a pressure transducer, interface circuitry, integrated timing reference, and a wireless transmitter integrated into a single die.",

        "abstract": "Capacitance sensors are widely used to measure various physical quantities, including position, pressure, and concentration of certain chemicals [1-6]. Integrating capacitive sensors into a small wireless sensor system is challenging due to their large power consumption relative to the total system power/energy budget, which can be as low as a few nW [4]. Typical capacitance-to-digital converters (CDCs) use charge sharing or charge transfer between capacitors to convert the sampled capacitance to voltage, which is then measured with an ADC [1-6]. This approach requires complex analog circuits, such as amplifiers and ADCs, increasing design complexity and often increasing power consumption. Moreover, the initial capacitance to voltage conversion essentially limits the input capacitance range because of output voltage saturation. This paper presents a fully digital CDC that is based on the observation that when a ring oscillator (RO) is powered from a charged capacitance, the number of RO cycles required to discharge the capacitance to a fixed voltage is naturally linear with the capacitance value. This observation enables a simple, fully digital conversion scheme that is inherently linear. As a result, the proposed CDC performs conversion across a very wide capacitance range from 0.7pF to over 10nF with <; 0.06% linearity error. The CDC senses 11.3pF input capacitance with 35.1 pJ conversion energy and 141fJ/c-s FoM.",

This is achieved with the help of a piece-wise charge transfer technique that eliminates the need for a large on-chip integration capacitor, a dual-integration-capacitor scheme that reduces the front-end noise contribution, a sampled-biasing technique that reduces the noise of the integration current, and a current-efficient inverter-based design.",

        "abstract": "Temperature sensors are widely used in microprocessors to monitor on-chip temperature gradients and hot-spots, which are known to negatively impact reliability [1-4]. Such sensors should be: 1) Small to facilitate floor planning; 2) Fast to track millisecond thermal transients and 3) Easy to trim to reduce the associated costs. Recently, it has been shown that thermal diffusivity (TD) sensors can meet these requirements [5]. TD sensors operate by digitizing the temperature-dependent delay associated with the diffusion of heat pulses through an electro-thermal filter (ETF), which, in standard CMOS, can be readily implemented as a resistive heater surrounded by a thermopile. Unlike BJT-based temperature sensors, their accuracy actually improves with CMOS scaling [6], since it is mainly limited by the accuracy of the heater/thermopile spacing, which in turn is determined by lithography. However, the readout circuitry of prior TD sensors has been based on analog phase-domain \u0394\u03a3 ADCs, which are not easily ported to low-voltage technologies, and which occupy much more area than the ETF itself [5].",

        "abstract": "High voltage applications such as electric motor controllers, solar panel power inverters, electric vehicle battery chargers, uninterrupted and switching mode power supplies benefit from the galvanic isolation of contactless current sensors (CCS) [1]. These include magnetic sensors that sense the magnetic field emanating from a current-carrying conductor. The offset and resolution of Hall-effect sensors is in the \u03bcT-level [1-3], in contrast to the \u03bcT-level accuracy of integrated-fluxgate (IFG) magnetometers [4]. Previously reported sampled-data closed-loop IFG readouts have limited BWs as their sampling frequencies (4) are limited to be less than or equal to the IFG excitation frequency, fEXC [5-7]. This paper describes a differential closed-loop IFG CCS with fs>fEXC. The differential architecture rejects magnetic stray fields and achieves 750x larger BW than the prior closed-loop IFG readouts [6-7] with 10\u00d7better offset than the Hall-effect sensors [1-3].",

Recent trends, including process technology scaling limits, new memory applications, and evolving high-performance and low-power requirements, have driven the development of emerging memories. As both discrete and embedded memory scaling becomes ever more challenging, there is a widespread effort to look for alternative memory technologies to replace the entrenched SRAM, DRAM, or Flash. This forum brings together systems designers to discuss memory needs for future applications and memory designers to describe the latest developments in emerging and next generation memories. The first three speakers summarize memory requirements from a system perspective to cover a broad range of applications, including servers, data-centric computing, clients, notebooks, tablets, watches, glasses, and thermostats. The fourth speaker describes general design challenges for emerging memory in embedded systems to bridge to the second half of the program, which considers specific memory technologies. Two speakers will then present the challenges and solutions for Flash and DRAM scaling while the last two speakers will highlight the latest developments in MRAM and RRAM.",

        "abstract": "In recent years the availability of products for wireless charging of mobile devices has increased rapidly. The introduction of the Qi standard for wireless power transfer has marked the beginning of what could be a revolution in the way we charge our smartphones and tablets. Wireless power transfer is considered for use in applications ranging from biomedicai implants that require a couple of milliwatts to electrical vehicles that require kiloWatts. The vision of a future where we can conveniently, efficiently and safely charge our devices and vehicles anywhere without having to drag adapters and cables with us is gradually starting to become more realistic. This forum aims to give an overview of the state-of-the art in wireless power transfer. The fundamentals of different wireless power transfer techniques will be discussed, including not only inductive and resonant magnetic, but also capacitive power transfer and RF energy harvesting.",

        "abstract": "The demand for ultra-high speed transceivers continues to rise exponentially due to the insatiable demand for high-throughput interconnect. Standards between 25 and 32Gb/s are rapidly approaching maturity, and available products and IPs at these rates are iterating to push down power while extending channel-loss recovery limits. Predictably, specifications are now in early stages for extending per-lane bandwith to between 40 and 64Gb/s. Meeting these 25Gb/s+ targets, especially for long-reach applications, is stressing the capabilities of both the underlying circuitry and the communication channels, and has caused significant rethinking of the overall system and circuit architectures for these links. In particular, the debate about multi-level (PAM4) versus binary (PAM2) signaling and which path offers the best energy-efficiency/data-rate scalability has returned to the foreground. Similarly, the emergence of high-speed ADCs with sufficient resolution for link applications has driven renewed interest in DSP-based approaches, while other efforts have pushed more analog/mixed-signal link components to over 60Gb/s/lane. To further ensure low BER operations, sophisticated coding such as FEC is brought into the discussion. Even in the domain of optical communications, significant challenges related to the bandwidth capabilities of the optical devices as well as the back end processing are currently being addressed. In fact, some of the highest speed optical links are limited by the short electrical interconnect between the driver circuitry and the optical module itself. This forum presents state-of-the-art I/O techniques enabling such high line rates across both optical and electrical interfaces as well as a number of emerging standards such as 802.3bj, various flavors of CEI, and HMC (hybrid memory cube).",

Device geometry, packing density, speed performance, and manufacturing cost of a single transistor have scaled together-according to Dennard scaling rule. Approaching the sub-10nm era and beyond, Moore's Law faces serious challenges in the near future (5\u20136 years). Device geometry/density/performance/cost will not scale simultaneously anymore. What are the new scaling rules for logic and memory? Researchers are racing to address 3 scenarios: 1) extending silicon, 2) beyond silicon, and 3) beyond CMOS.",

This panel will shake things up with a combination of circuit gems and design methodologies mined from the brains of some of our community's most creative individuals. Prof. Asad Abidi will explain the operation of a common yet often inadequately understood circuit containing just a single FET. Barrie Gilbert will then amaze you with a collection of translinear circuits exploiting the mighty BJT. Jan Craninckx will take a different tack, showing that true magic is possible nowadays with digitally-assisted analog design, in which calibration blocks form the basic units of creativity. Professors Shoji Kawahito and Rinaldo Castello will return to straight circuits, showing gems used in imaging ICs and power-efficient rail-to-rail amplifiers. Lastly, Prof. Huei Wang will bring the discussion back to design techniques by asking if traditional RF design is a Lost Art, perhaps deservedly so.",

In the competitive and fast-paced semiconductor industry, most jobs require people to do at least a little (but more often a lot) of both. And your answer may change on a daily or hourly basis. But how do corporations, universities and the technologists at the heart of these organizations strike the right balance between blue-sky innovation and disciplined execution? What priorities and policies distinguish the industry leaders from the industry followers?",

Especially video and Cloud services drive wireless data consumption, and 1000x in data capacity is targeted in the next 10 years. 5G is in the process of being defined and may include data rates at Gb/s, seamless integration of wireless LAN, short latencies, expansion into mm-Wave, and massive MIMO. The envisioned systems likely reach the limits of Shannon's capacity and will exploit additional degrees of freedom. A group of experts has been invited to share their thoughts on key new technologies and their path to implementation.",
