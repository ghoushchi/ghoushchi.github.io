Current reduction techniques have been actively investigated as they become a key factor to increase battery lifetime. To reduce BOM cost, external low-noise amplifier (eLNA) usage and discrete passive components have to be minimized with simple interfaces, which influences the number of PCB Iayers and stacks. This work is oriented to provide a low-power and low-cost cellular RF transceiver that supports 2G, 3G, and 4G as well as new-radio (NR) frequency range1 (FR1) with a dual-mode Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) implemented in a 14nm FinFET CMOS technology.

      "abstract":"The rapid development of high-speed communication and radar systems has placed stringent requirements on the spectral purity of RF oscillators. Also, maximizing battery lifetime, efficiency, or power consumption is of great concern for these systems. The oscillator is thus required to have a low phase noise as well as a high figure-of-merit (FoM). Recently, to reduce the noise sensitivity of the LC oscillator, various harmonic shaping techniques [1] -[3]have been reported. By setting the differential-mode (DM) [1], [2] or common-mode (CM) [1], [3] resonances at specific harmonic frequencies, the impulse sensitive function (ISF) is reduced, and a high FoM could be achieved. However, to meet the strict relationship between fundamental frequency and resonances, the frequency tuning plan is complex, and the frequency range is limited. Besides, the minimum phase noise performance is still limited by the reduced power supply of advanced process and the maximum power taken by a single-core resonate tank. To overcome these limitations, the low-phase-noise oscillators have evolved from the single-core to multi-core types [4], [5]. By coupling N oscillators together, it is possible to burn N times higher power and decrease the phase noise by 10log(N), with the FoM unchanged. Nevertheless, the multi-core coupling method needs to be designed carefully to prevent concurrent oscillations [5]. Meanwhile, the conventional multi-core oscillators only achieve an average FoM of 189dB/Hz [4], [5], which is significantly worse than the state-of-the-art single-core oscillators. This paper proposes a distributed-boosting and harmonic-impedance-expanding multi-core oscillator, which can achieve low phase noise and high FoM simultaneously. A distributed-coupling transformer is introduced to obtain the distributed-boosting effect and maintain the coupling relationship of the four oscillator cores. The expanded DM and CM resonances are allocated for harmonic shaping over a wide frequency range. Prototyped in a conventional 40nm CMOS technology, the proposed oscillator operating at 3. 09GHz achieves the phase noise as low as -138.9dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset, 195.1dBc/Hz FoM, and 26.6% tuning range.",

      "abstract":"This session covers a wide variety of imagers and range sensors for different applications. For imagers, innovations are reported achieving smaller pixel pitch, higher frame rate or increased on-board intelligence. For ranging, improved SPAD and MEMS based LIDAR are presented and improved depth sensing is achieved. The first paper describes a photodiode-based indirect Time-of-Flight (iToF) depth sensor, followed by three Single Photon Avalanche Diodes (SPAD) based range sensors: a direct Time-of-Flight (dToF) flash LiDAR, a LiDAR system using MEMS mirrors for scanning, and a flash LiDAR with smaller pitch and advanced process node. The next paper presents a SPAD-based photon-counting imager to eliminate the SNR dip problem in photodiode-based high-dynamic-range imagers, followed by a conventional color imager with high resolution, larger pixels, and low noise for digital cameras. The last three papers describe a programmable convolutional imager with near-sensor processing for embedded computer vision applications, a large-format imager for computational imaging with adaptive dynamic range control, and a conventional color imager with high resolution and smaller pixels for smartphone and mobile applications.",

      "abstract":"Automotive headlamp and/or taillamp tend to integrate a high number of LEDs (up to 30 LEDs in series) for sequential turn signal light. As the LEDs are turned on/off sequentially, the output voltage across the LED string (VOUT) can be below, equal to, or above the input battery voltage (VIN) which also experiences a large transient from 4 to 60V. To achieve accurate and stable LED current regulation over such a wide operation voltage range, high-voltage buck-boost converters are desperately demanded [1-4]. Although highswitching-frequency (fSW) solutions have been explored as in [4, 5], the stringent thermal and size limitations imposed by automotive applications have made it increasingly challenging to continue using silicon-FET-based converters. Gallium-Nitride (GaN) FET, which offers a 5× lower capacitance and nearly zero reverse recovery to enable an efficient high-voltage operation at high fSW (>2MHz), has been proven to be a very promising device in this scenario [5]. However, severe electromagnetic interference (EMI) due to high fSW operation and complicated bootstrap GaN gate driving become very challenging for GaN buck-boost LED drivers in automotive applications.",

      "abstract":"In recent developments, image sensors are no longer simply a means for collecting optical signals, but rather, are increasingly expected to serve as intelligent systems with surrounding configurations. Coded exposure (CE) is one of the methods applied in intelligent systems approaches, and various functions can be realized by the selection of the integration variable in the plenoptic function. High DR can be realized if the integration variable is time. A variety of means to achieve high DR have been proposed in the literature, for example, a method that provides a plurality of detection capacitors (LOFIC,) or a method of preventing saturation by adding low-sensitivity pixels. These methods often require an enlarged pixel size. Alternatively, high-speed readout like an array parallel stacked structure is useful for integrating multiple frames to realize high DR. However, this leads to an increase in noise and needs faster readout to reduce motion artifacts. In order to mitigate the adverse effects, a method has been proposed in which a pixel array is divided into a plurality of blocks and the signal integration time of each block is individually controlled. Another method was described in which CE was demonstrated by using pixel level control of the exposure time. However, in these methods, it was necessary to arrange the readout path and control circuitry within the same plane because these are non-stacked sensors, so the pixel size was relatively large and high resolution was difficult to realize. To overcome the above problems, we report a sensor that can simultaneously achieve 4K×4K resolution and 1000fps high-speed readout. Using a stacked structure, we demonstrate coded exposure capability by individually controlling exposure time for each block of pixels.",

      "abstract":"Physically unclonable functions (PUF) have emerged as a promising solution for secure and low-cost key storage and hardware authentication. A key challenge in PUF designs is ensuring the reliability, or reproducibility of PUF keys under environmental variations. While error correction codes (ECC) could help achieve 100% reliable keys [7], [9], [10], the overhead of the design grows with the worst-case bit-error rate (BER), which will become intractable in mass production (Fig. 36.5.1). Thus, physically more reliable PUF designs are highly desired to alleviate the burden on ECC. State-of-the-art PUF circuit topologies [1] could reduce the native BER to less than 0.5%, but have not shown the potential for another order of magnitude BER reduction. Meanwhile, temporal/spatial majority voting [4], [5], [8] and burn-in [7] are common physical stabilization methods, but with limited efficacy. Dark (unstable) bit masking, on the other hand, has shown great potential to suppress BER before ECC. Finding potential dark bits across the full operating range is nontrivial. Extensive testing across temperatures is expensive and does not completely remove error bits when the evaluations is insufficient [10]. Recently, a few dark bit detection techniques at nominal conditions were proposed. By perturbing a PUF cell in opposite directions, cells with small native mismatch and high flip probability can be identified. Sweeping body biasing has no area overhead and improves BER by 98%, but suffers from low detection accuracy and thus a large number of falsely discarded cells [1]. The latest capacitive tilting in SRAM PUFs [2] and ground resistance insertion in EE SRAM PUFs [3] could detect all unstable bits in the experiments, but still suffer from low detection accuracy.",

      "abstract":"Future multi-band software-defined-radio base-stations for digital beamforming and massive MIMO applications depend heavily on the availability of highly linear and compact data converters with good power efficiency, while at the same time offering multi-GHz signal-bandwidth at sampling rates well in excess of 10GS/s. Wideband RF-sampling D/A-converters have traditionally been implemented in current-steering architectures, mostly with extensive calibration infrastructure [1] -[3]. The transistor stack required to achieve the necessary static and dynamic output impedance for the code-steered current sources leads to limited supply voltage scalability, while the capacitive self-loading by the current-source array makes true wideband matching at the RF-output inherently difficult. Capacitive digital-to-analog converters (C-DAC) have been widely used as RF DAC or switched-capacitor power amplifiers. Up to now digital transmitters have used C-DACs with inherent mixing functionality in polar or IQ systems for synthesis of high-power RF signals of moderate bandwidth of up to 160MHz [4] -[6]. This work uses a capacitive DAC as a direct RF-sampling DAC with moderate output power level for direct signal synthesis over a bandwidth from 0.5GHz up to at least 8GHz.",

      "abstract":"Autonomous driving systems, when deployed to market, will require accurate and high-speed recognition, judgment and operation. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) require large amounts of computation for pattern recognition. The CNN performance required for level-3 autonomous driving systems is 120TOPS or higher. As shown in Fig. 4.2.1, recent CNN implementations are oriented toward high performance and low power [1] -[4]. In previously reported SoCs for autonomous driving [5], power consumption is more than 70W, requiring a heavy and expensive water-cooling system. To save weight and cost by using an air-cooling system for an in-vehicle electronics control unit (ECU), power consumption less than 25W is indispensable and around half of that can be assigned for the SoC. Consequently, achieving 120TOPS with 10TOPS/W is necessary for an autonomous driving system. At the same time, achieving the ASIL D standard, the highest safety level defined in ISO 26262, is also required for SoCs for autonomous driving. Dual-core lock step (DCLS) is a technique to satisfy ASIL D by comparing the results of parallel execution of the same process in duplicated hardware. However, simple full-time DCLS doubles power consumption and degrades power efficiency. In this paper, we achieve 60.4TOPS CNN performance with 13.8TOPS/W efficiency in an application processor having high-reliability ASIL D targeted safety mechanisms for autonomous driving system. One and two-device configurations achieving performance of 60 and 120TOPS, respectively, for ADAS and autonomous driving offer practical solutions for products.",

      "abstract":"Low power digital signal processing (DSP) and optical integration have fueled the development of high-performance optical pluggable modules due to their deployment flexibility and network disaggregation. In addition, the rapid growth of new technologies such as 5G, cloud computing, IoT and AR/VR has prompted the demand for even higher data rates, requiring optical modules to scale beyond 400Gb/s while targeting the best possible tradeoff between power efficiency and reach. This necessitates more complex equalization schemes and coding techniques such as probabilistic shaping (PS) [1] and drives ever higher the specifications of analog building blocks. These requirements, as a result, constantly push the envelope of traditional analog-front-end (AFE) bandwidth and the rates of companion data converters such as DACs and ADCs to the technology limits, making it challenging to address a diversity of DSP modulation needs and oversampling rates while maintaining low power consumption. In this paper, we present an energy efficient optical transceiver fully integrated in a 400G coherent DSP chip using 4 reconfigurable 40-97GS/s 8b DACs and ADCs with a 40GHz AFE bandwidth, fabricated in a 7nm FinFET process.",

      "abstract":"The integration of complex DSP functions together with the entire RF-frontend enables software-defined base-station radio and mandates the availability of power-efficient and compact data converters in advanced digital CMOS processes. In a self-calibrated RF sampling ADC-system, a co-integrated digital non-linear post-equalizer (NLEQ) can substantially increase the receiver performance [1], but wideband ADC-calibration also requires a wideband, calibration-free and ultra-linear reference signal source to train the NLEQ-coefficients during a dedicated calibration period, for example at startup, or during maintenance intervals. Another function with renewed importance in complex transceiver systems is the analog built-in-self-test (aBIST) capability [2] to spot-check the performance of data converters and RF-frontend building blocks, for example during scheduled test intervals in the field. In this work, a single-bit calibration-DAC (CALDAC), capable of wideband reference signal and linear sinewave generation at fclk/4 for these applications is presented. With fclk=16GHz and 4×-interpolation, the CALDAC effectively samples at 64GS/s and implements a semi-digital FIR-architecture [3-5].",

      "abstract":"Substantial progress has been made on a new computer architecture, known as an annealing processor (AP) [1-4]. The AP can effectively solve NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems by providing a fast method for finding the grand state of an Ising model. In particular, various types of APs based on a CMOS process (CMOS-AP) significantly improve the scalability and power efficiency of the annealing system by utilizing fast parallel spin updates on the basis of simulated annealing (SA) [2-4]. Further development of CMOS-APs requires overcoming two challenges: improving the accuracy of the annealing processing by expanding the bitwidth of coefficients and attaining a multi-chip annealing system consisting of AP chips with 8-way connectivity. In this work, we developed a scalable CMOS-AP with two key technologies: (i) A flip-flop (FF)-based spin circuit allowing expandable bitwidth by reproducing the Metropolis algorithm, which is SA with a fixed temperature, and (ii) an inter-chip interface (I/F) with a data-compression method utilizing annealing characteristics to obtain multi-chip operation without degrading annealing speed and accuracy. The CMOS-AP demonstrated multichip operation of the 9×16k spin system with an annealing speed 233× faster and a calculation energy 972× lower than running SG3 on a CPU.",

      "abstract":"Recent approaches toward a functional retinal prosthesis to restore vision in neurodegenerative patients have been limited by the number of pixels that can be individually stimulated. The conventional approach, shown in Fig. 18.1.1 (left), uses an external camera to capture video, whose information is then wirelessly delivered to a hermetic housing (typically a titanium can) for conversion to N distinct stimulation pulses fed transocularly to an N-channel microelectrode array (MEA) placed epi- or subretinally. While this approach has proven long-term biocompatibility, translation to 1000s of channels with hermetic and durable transocular connections is not achievable with current technology, limiting existing designs to at most 256 channels, barely sufficient for 20/400 vision restoration [1] -[3]. Instead, recent work has suggested a full-CMOS solution, where an image sensor, stimulation circuits, and an MEA are integrated directly onto a single CMOS chip, thereby eliminating the interconnect challenge and providing a pathway to scalability [4], [5] (Fig. 18.1.1, middle). However, co-location of photoreceptors, amplifiers, and stimulation circuits imposes difficult fill-factor issues, while also significantly increasing heat dissipation near sensitive ocular and neural tissue due to the need to perform voltage regulation, amplification, and charge-balanced stimulation waveform generation (typical end-to-end efficiency of ~20%) right next to the retina. Most importantly, since the CMOS chip must also include electrodes and yet be sufficiently thin to fit epi- or sub-retinally, current encapsulation methods rely on thin-film deposition to enable patterned electrode windows, which has unproven long-term hemiticity or biocompatibility when encapsulating CMOS which has known biological toxins (e.g., copper), limiting practical implementation.",

      "abstract":"For years, there has been a strong drive for sub-micron pixel development, in spite of reaching the visible light diffraction limit, because a smaller pixel pitch of CMOS image sensors (CISs) is inevitably required for ever-miniaturizing camera modules as mobile devices incorporate more cameras, few of which are dedicated to ultra-high-resolution zoomed images [1]. To that end, image sensor vendors have tried to find new ways to avoid reduction in sensitivity and more crosstalk in the sensor through pixel architecture change and/or fabrication process refinement [2-4]. For example, a 0.7μm pixel sensor was demonstrated with acceptable photodiode (PD) full-well capacity (FWC) of >6,000eas well as signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of -32dB without optical/electrical crosstalk by employing state-of-the-art full-depth deep-trench isolations (FDTIs). [4] However, further scaling requires elaborate fabrication innovation and layout ideas. At the same time, meeting every aspect of pixel performance compared to the previous generation becomes even more difficult, e.g., with respect to dark or illuminated characteristics, fixed-pattern or temporal noises, etc. The latter, in particular, is associated with in-pixel source-follower (SF) amplifiers. Therefore, electrical performance of scaled in-pixel transistors cannot be overlooked. In this paper, a 32-megpixel (MP) CIS with 0.64μm unit pixels is demonstrated with FDTI design. Innovations in terms of fabrication and design to achieve this performance with scaling are discussed.",

      "abstract":"COVID-19 sparked a paradigm shift for businesses, education, and social life. The measures taken have emphasized, more than ever, the importance of on-line communication platforms. Online streaming services, education tools, and workplace communication tools all experienced a multifold increase in demand in 2020 as the world population was under a lockdown. Service providers' ability to meet these demands relies on the capacity of mega-scale data centers (MSDC). Hence, capacity and bandwidth of MSDCs are expected to grow exponentially. The transition from 12.8 to 51.2Tb/s switches for data centers leaf and spine is underway, and is expected to deploy starting in 2021~2022 [1]. Unfortunately, the increase of switch throughput comes with serious area, yield, and power limitations. To mitigate the problem, recent advances in chiplets and multi-die technologies for high throughput switches show a promising increase in yield and lower solution cost. Another direction is silicon photonic and ASIC co-integration, which allows for package throughput well beyond the electrical interface capability.",

      "abstract":"Many applications, such as multi-standard wireless and event-driven IoT devices, demand high-resolution ADCs with scalable sampling rate and power consumption. The conventional pipelined ADC can achieve high resolution, but its power does not scale well with the sampling rate due to the use of a closed-loop static OTA for residue amplification. While the OTA can be turned off to save power, it requires considerable time for the bias circuit and CMFB loop to settle when waking up, leading to wasted power and reduced peak operation frequency. Using an open-loop dynamic amplifier can make power scale linearly with frequency, but its gain varies with PVT and often requires background calibration, which converges slowly and is incompatible with event-driven applications. The ring-amp is a promising solution as it features closed-loop operation, easy duty-cycling, and decaying power over time [1]-[4]. However, its stability depends on the dead zone size, which typically requires trimming across PVT variations. Besides, the 1st stage has a constant operating point during amplification, which consumes considerable energy. A recent work proposed a 2-stage floating inverter amplifier (FIA) that is fully dynamic and works in closed-loop [5]. It guarantees stability and does not need dead zone control. Moreover, the power consumptions of all stages decay over time naturally. Nevertheless, its low open-loop gain of 33dB is inadequate for a high-resolution pipelined ADC, and its fast-quenching 2nd stage reduces the amplifier speed, limiting the usage in high-speed designs.",

      "abstract":"Recently, both the number of smart devices and the amount of data transfered to and from these devices have grown at unprecedented rates. To provide users with a highquality experience, wireless LAN plays a key role among various wireless standards. Wi-Fi 6E extends the available bandwidth, enhances spectral efficiency, increases data rate, and serves more users simultaneously in public areas. To support 1024-QAM in bandwidths up to 160MHz while maintaining sufficient EVM, the ADC has to achieve inband DR of 63-70dB over 80MHz baseband bandwidth. SAR ADCs are used extensively in Wi-Fi receivers due to their low power consumption and small area. But for DR > 60dB, quantization noise and comparator noise become the dominant noise sources. Noise shaping embedded within a SAR ADC has been utilized to suppress these noise sources with minimal overhead [1-2]. The maximum reported conversion rate of 10 to 12b 1b/step SAR ADCs is ~400MS/s, and hence the available bandwidth is limited to 50MHz given an OSR of 4-6. The NS pipeline-SAR ADC [3] was introduced to overcome this limitation by virtue of its superior speed, but at the cost of an active amplifier and calibration. To enlarge the bandwidth and increase the SNR of a SAR ADC, a timeinterleaved noise-shaping SAR (TINS-SAR) architecture is a promising solution [4]. This work presents a passive TI noise-shaping technique to enable a power-efficient, PVT-robust ADC for 80MHz BW and 70dB DR.",

As an emerging solution, the multimodal sensing becomes essential and boosts applications in automotive, defence, transportation, life-rescue, and hazard identification, etc. [1]. X-band RADAR exhibits a good balance between free-space loss and directivity, providing bandwidth (BW)dependent range resolution and penetration despite weather conditions in far range. On the other hand, LiDAR features a sub-mm spatial resolution [2], complementarily providing accurate detection in near range. In Fig. 14.2.1, a conceptual system of phased-array RADAR associated with LiDAR (RALDAR) is developed for a radio-laser fusion sensing in the analog domain, taking advantages of the complementary sensing in terms of speed, range and resolution, etc, and more importantly the real-time processing capability of the early fusion.",

      "abstract":"Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a key non-invasive technique to extract vital signs like heart rate (HR), heart rate variability (HRV), and blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). Integrated in smartwatches, health patches and finger clips, PPG sensors are widely used in fitness, glucose, blood pressure, and medical monitoring with good user comfort. Integrating PPG in medical chest patches is interesting for COVID-19 patients since it can yield, next to HR and respiration, also SpO2, which traditional ECG-based patches cannot provide. However, measuring PPG/SpO2 on the chest is challenging due to large motion artifacts, small AC/DC perfusion index (PI<; 0.1%), and ambient light. Therefore, it poses a more stringent requirement on dynamic range (DR > 120 dB) for the PPG readout circuit, while still requiring low power consumption for long battery life. On-chip pinned-photodiodes (PPDs) have been used as passive integrators, resulting in very low power consumption (2.63μW) for the PPG readout [1]. However, the DR and linearity can be limited by the PPDs' parasitic capacitors. Direct light-todigital converter (LDC) topologies are proposed in [2-4], but their DR is still below 120dB. In [5], a digital-controlled TIA is exploited to control the transimpedance gain, which extends the DR to 130dB while consuming 72μW in the analog front-end (AFE).",

      "abstract":"Quantum computing holds the promise to solve many of today's intractable problems. A solid-state quantum computer (QC) is generally made of an array of qubits implemented in one of many solid-state technologies and operating at deep-cryogenic temperatures (10-to-20mK). Silicon spin qubits are a promising candidate for scalable QCs, due to their size, long coherence times and potential for co-integration with the required classical control and readout electronics. Recently, semiconductor spin qubits have been demonstrated to operate at ~1K, thus accelerating the achievement of a compact QC [1]. Classical qubit control electronics has also progressed, with the demonstration of fully-integrated control of spin qubits [2] and transmons [3] implemented in a cryo-CMOS technology. While a cryo-CMOS integrated circuit has been co-integrated with quantum dots [4], fully-integrated readout electronics has not yet been addressed in the literature.",

      "abstract":"The increasing demands for compact, low-cost, and high-resolution radar systems have pushed the operation frequency to the terahertz range due to the shorter wavelength and larger available bandwidth [1-5]. However, the best-reported range resolution cannot go below 1.5mm with a 100GHz bandwidth [1], which is not enough for many industrial applications like small-defect detection and surface screening. Moreover, most previous works [3-5] are based on conventional transceiver architectures that use separate antennas for TX and RX or use parallel multi-antenna designs to increase the frequency bandwidth [1]. These structures not only increase the chip size but also degrade the radar performance when they are placed at the focal point of a collimating lens. This degradation occurs due to the separated antenna phase centers, which are not well located at the collimating lens focal point, causing a multi-beam radiation pattern. To overcome these challenges, we have adopted an autodyne FMCW radar structure [6,7] with a phase processing method on the radar IF signal [7]. The autodyne is an oscillator that simultaneously carries out functions of generating the transmission and mixing the transmitted and reflected signals. There is no separate path for the RX signal in the autodyne, as the radiated and reflected signals exist at the same point of the autodyne circuit. Hence, it utilizes a combined antenna with a single-phase center for both transmitting and receiving parts. Besides, the phase processing method allows us to measure short ranges with an error no more than one-tenth of one-percent, which in terahertz frequencies provides micrometer resolutions [7]. Using these approaches, this paper demonstrates an autodyne FMCW radar with 66.7GHz bandwidth from 191GHz to 257.7GHz with a minimum range resolution of 54μm. Across state-of-the-art, this design improves the range resolution by 28 times.",

With efficiencies approaching those of buck converters, SIMO converters allow multiple domains to share a single inductor, thus reducing the use of bulky passive components [1-5]. However, SIMO converters suffer from a poor transient response and significant ripple, requiring extensive Vdd margining.

      "abstract":"Since 2001 [1], LC VCOs have been demonstrating significant improvements of figureof-merit (FoM) and 1/f3 phase noise (PN) corner [2-5] by exploring common-mode (CM) resonance at twice the oscillation frequency (2FOSC). In addition, for area reduction, the shaping of the impulse sensitivity function (ISF) has evolved from explicit with two coils [1] to implicit with one coil [2]. Yet, as depicted in Fig. 20.1.1, the latter suffers from large CM magnetic-flux cancellation, resulting in a much lower CM impedance |ZCM| that is -0.64 of its differential-mode (DM) impedance |ZDM|. The VCO in [3] achieves a high FoM@10MHz up to 191.4dBc/Hz by boosting |ZCM| at 2FOSC and |ZDM| at 3FOSC. Yet, to uphold an optimal performance over the tuning range (TR), the VCO in [3]still requires manual harmonic tuning for aligning the 1st-to-2nd and 1st-to-3rd harmonic resonances. This denotes a narrowband effect. For the VCO in [4], which features a four-winding transformer with no harmonic tuning, there is a large variation of FoM@10MHz (190.7 to 196.5dBc/Hz) and 1/f3 PN corner (60 to 600kHz) across the TR.",

      "abstract":"Quantum computing promises exponential speed-up in solving certain complex problems that would be intractable by classical computers. However, thousands or millions of qubits might be required to solve useful problems. High-precision and low-noise electrical signals are required to manipulate and read the state of a qubit and to control qubit-to-qubit interactions. Current systems use room temperature electronics with many coax cables routed to the qubit chip inside a dilution refrigerator. This approach does not scale to large number of qubits, due to form factor, cost, power consumption and thermal load to the fridge. To address this challenge, a cryogenic qubit controller has been proposed [1]. The first integrated implementation of a cryogenic pulse modulator has been presented in [2], demonstrating the capability of manipulating (drive) the state of superconducting qubits. The work in [3] extends the capability of the controller with 3 main features: frequency-multiplexing to reduce the number of RF cables per qubit, an arbitrary I/Q pulse generation for improved control fidelity and a digitally-intensive architecture with integrated instruction set to enable integration in existing quantum control stacks. This work further advances the prior art by integrating the capability of reading the qubit state and generating the voltage pulses required for drive, readout, 2-qubit operations and qubit characterization. The SoC can drive up to 16 spin qubits by frequency multiplexing over a single RF line, read the state of up to 6 qubits simultaneously and control up to 22 gate potentials. The SoC also integrates a $\\mu$-controller for increased flexibility in implementing the control instruction set. The proposed cryogenic controller can replace all the high-speed control electronics used in conventional solutions today, paving the way towards scalable quantum computers.",

      "abstract":"Efficient high-conversion-ratio power delivery is needed for many portable computing applications which require sub-volt supply rails but operate from batteries or USB power sources. In such applications, the power management unit should have a small volume, area, and height while providing fast transient response. Past work has shown favorable performance of hybrid switched-capacitor (SC) converters to reduce the size of needed inductor(s), which can soft-charge high-density SC networks while supporting efficient voltage regulation [1-5]. However, the hybrid approach has its own challenges including balancing the voltage of the flying capacitor and achieving safe but fast startup. Rapid supply transients, including startup, can cause voltage stress on power switches if flying capacitors are not quickly regulated. Past approaches such as precharge networks [3] or fast balancing control [5] have startup times that are on the order of milliseconds. This paper presents a two-stage cascaded hybrid SC converter that features a fast transient response with automatic flying capacitor balancing for low-voltage applications (i.e., 5V:0.4 to 1.2V from a USB interface). The converter is nearly standalone and all gate drive supplies are generated internally. Measured results show a peak efficiency of 96.9%, <; 36mV under/overshoot for 1A/μs load transients, and self-startup time on the order of 10μs (over 100× faster than previous works).",

For computing, two papers demonstrate: 1) RRAM-based in-memory computing for deep convolutional neural networks, and 2) a dynamic-precision bit-serial spatial accelerator for solving differential equations. For clocking, three papers demonstrate: 1) a fast-lock wide-range clock generator with asynchronous adaptive-droop mitigation, 2) a fractional-N MDLL with a background DTC calibration, and 3) a fractional output divider with replica-DTC-free background calibration. The last three papers focus on digital power management, demonstrating: 1) a distributed digital low-dropout (DLDO) voltage regulator with a high power density and a wide load current range in 5nm FinFET technology; 2) a single-inductor 4-output power converter with dynamic droop allocation and adaptive clocking, and 3) an ultra-low-power SoC with integrated dynamic voltage stacking.",

      "abstract":"From the cloud to edge devices, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are widely used in many cognitive tasks, such as image classification and speech recognition. In recent years, research on hardware accelerators for AI edge devices has received more attention, mainly due to the advantages of AI at the edge: including privacy, low latency, and more reliable and effective use of network bandwidth. However, traditional computing architectures (such as CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and even existing AI accelerator ASICs) cannot meet the future needs of energy-constrained AI edge applications. This is because ML computing is data-centric, most of the energy in these architectures is consumed by memory accesses. In order to improve energy efficiency, both academia and industry are exploring a new computing architecture, namely compute in memory (CIM). CIM research is focused on a more analog approach with high-energy efficiency; however, lack of accuracy, due to a low SNR, is the main disadvantage; therefore, an analog approach may not be suitable for some applications that require high accuracy.",

In CMOS, Hall-effect sensors are widely used, but their resistance results in a fundamental trade-off between BW and resolution. Coils have a differentiating characteristic and so can achieve much wider BW and resolution, but cannot sense DC.",

      "abstract":"The advent of the next-generation wireless communication standards demands increasingly faster transceivers, posing extremely challenging requirements on the frequency-synthesizer integrated jitter [1,2]. As demonstrated in [1], the bang-bang digital-PLL (DPLL) architecture can meet the required jitter performance while synthesizing fractional-N frequencies, and it is highly attractive for its reduced power consumption, compact footprint, and straightforward integration in modern scaled CMOS technologies. However, due to the intrinsic bang-bang phase-detector (BBPD) quantization noise, analog PLLs still achieve superior performance in terms of the jitter-power product [2]. To overcome the BBPD quantization noise in DPLLs, [3] relies on an 8b ADC to digitize the PLL phase error with a physical resolution below the input jitter, leading to increased design complexity, with an area and power penalty. The first attempt to reduce the quantization noise of a 1b TDC was done in [4] by implementing a charge-pump-based ΔΣ TDC in a fractional-N DPLL. Unfortunately, the large delay introduced in the delta modulation path has so far hindered its adoption in low-jitter DPLLs. This work presents a 13GHz fractional-N DPLL achieving 79.5fs random jitter and 107.6fs jitter including spurs in near-integer channels. The DPLL is based on a BBPD with (i) quantization noise shaping with a fine and tunable delta modulation, and (ii) a digital background adaptive-shaping-control technique to optimally reduce the BBPD quantization.",

      "abstract":"Over 253 million people worldwide suffer from permanent visual impairments (e.g., glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration) that cannot be rectified using refractive correction or surgery. Such patients rely on canes, monoculars, or service dogs for mobility, which while effective, do not provide rich information and are not hands-free. Recently, low-vision augmented-reality (AR) headsets have been developed to provide hands-free, real-time, enhanced-image overlays that highlight objects and obstacles. However, social stigma and form factor impede their adoption. We introduce a complete, enhanced-image overlay solution for a socially transparent AR contact lens for low-vision patients that provides a rich set of controllable image overlays such as contrast enhancement, edge detection, and zoom. The lens consists of three main components: an outward-looking imager, an image processor, and a microLED display. The lens captures the scene from the wearer's central vision, performs a user-specified image processing task (e.g., edge detection), and sends the result to the display, which, along with its miniature optics, projects images directly onto the retina, highlighting outlines of real-world objects.",

Typical headphone drivers use Class-A/AB topologies, and to improve power efficiency, Class-G/H drivers with a ground-center operation are used at the expense of using external components to decouple the required extra supply rails [1-3]. Closed-loop Class-D speaker drivers have become popular [4-6], and filter-less configurations are common in the 1-to-3W output range [6]. Some of the challenges associated with a Class-D driver for headphone applications are to maintain high linearity and SNR for low-voltage supply rails while reducing quiescent power. This paper describes a digital input, 93% efficient, filter-less Class-D amplifier achieving 113dB SNR and -93dB THD+N while operating from a single 1.8V supply.",

      "abstract":"This paper describes a new CPU subsystem featured in a 5G mobile SoC. The High-Performance (HP) core achieves a 3GHz clock frequency with full production yield across the fabrication range and operating environment. In contrast to previously published work [1], a third, balanced-performance (BP), gear is introduced which features a power-optimized implementation of the high-performance (HP) core. Physical implementation differences of the BP and HP cores are illustrated, while circuit techniques developed to enable full-yield 3GHz operation are detailed. A die photograph alongside a more detailed HP core CAD drawing are shown in Fig. 4.1.7 and the cluster topology, including architectural features, is summarized in Fig. 4.1.1.",

      "abstract":"The demand for massive MIMO, digital beamforming, and increased bandwidth communication dramatically increases the complexity of the remote radio head in future cellular base-stations. This complexity issue can be addressed by RF transceiver SoCs incorporating multiple direct RF radio transceivers, which have clear advantages over conventional architectures and are enabled by high-performance digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). However, the sampling clock for these high-performance data converters must fulfill very stringent in-band and out-of-band spectral mask requirements, which are hard to meet with RF frequency synthesizers integrated on the SoC. All digital PLLs (ADPLLs) utilize the advantages of scaled nodes and rely on advanced digital signal-processing techniques to boost performance. Sub-sampling ADPLLs (SS-ADPLL) enable the usage of an energy-efficient time-to-digital converter (TDC) since the TDC noise is multiplied by a smaller factor [1]. This work presents a sub-sampling ADPLL with stochastic-flash TDC (SFTDC) and coupled dual-core DCO achieving 47.3fsrms jitter performance in 16nm FinFET CMOS.",

      "abstract":"The performance and robustness of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) phased-array transmitters (TXs) define, to a large extent, the quality of a high-data-rate 5G link. In practical situations, however, this TX performance is strongly affected by mutual coupling among the closely-spaced radiating elements in the phased-array antenna, yielding a beam-steering angle-dependent and time-varying loading or VSWR condition. Furthermore, 5G mm-wave systems typically employ spectrally efficient modulation schemes with high peak-to-average power ratios (PAPRs). This requirement demands the TX power amplifier (PA) to operate in power back-off (PBO), thus degrading its average efficiency. To alleviate this issue, outphasing or Doherty PAs (DPAs) can be adopted [1-4]. However, as depicted in Fig. 14.4.1 (Top left), these efficiency-enhancement techniques will worsen the output reflection coefficient of the PA (ΓPA). Consequently, the unwanted “element-to-element” coupled signal reflects back to the antenna and will deteriorate the phased-array beam pattern and its TX linearity. A previously promoted solution for this antenna VSWR problem is load mismatch detection, followed by tuning of the output matching network (self-healing). However, this requires the use of a reconfigurable and inevitably lossy matching network [5]. Also, active load pulling [1] and using a reconfigurable series/parallel DPA configuration [2] have been proposed to realize a VSWR resilient efficiency-enhanced TX. Nevertheless, all these techniques are only suitable when dealing with a known and stable antenna impedance mismatch, which is, unfortunately, not the case in practical situations.",

The transition from 3b/cell (TLC) to 4b/cell (QLC) is a significant step towards delivering higher bit density. The increased program/erase (P/E) window, in 3D NAND technology, combined with improved program algorithms to alleviate interference from neighboring WL cells, has led to the successful deployment of two generations of QLC floating gate (FG) 3D NAND technology [1]. Further improvement in bit density, as well as the read and write performance will accelerate the adoption rate of QLC NAND into data-storage systems.",

      "abstract":"The four main passive circuit elements include the resistor, capacitor, inductor, and transformer. Inductors and transformers have been notoriously challenging to integrate in silicon, and they occupy a significant chip area. The limited metallization and conductive substrate result in a poor quality factor (Q) and limited self-resonance frequency. The tuning of inductor-based resonators is further challenged by the limited tuning range and Q of switched-capacitors/inductors. Recent LPTV N-path structures have demonstrated new functionalities that address some of these challenges, such as equivalent second-order LC bandpass filtering, lowpass filtering, notch filtering, and non-magnetic nonreciprocity [1-5]. Transformers face additional challenges of limited coupling coefficients, especially when a large turns ratio is desired [6], but they are critical to impedance transformation and matching networks. This paper describes an impedance-transforming N-path filter offering passive voltage gain, which realizes transformer-based coupled-resonator functionality that (i) features the traditional N-path benefits of high Q, high linearity, and LO-defined tuning, (ii) enables ideal coupling (k=1) regardless of the step-up ratio, (iii) can be cascaded with no transfer-function nonideality to achieve even higher step-up voltage gain with high out-of-band (OOB) rejection, (iv) emulates transformer behavior over a wide range of frequencies despite being single-ended (SE), and (v) has ultra-low clock-power consumption. The concepts are validated through two -0.1-to-1GHz 65nm CMOS prototypes that achieve step-up ratios (n) of 4 and 8 with k of 1, voltage gains of 15dB and 17dB at 500MHz with 27dB and 33dB OOB rejection, and buffer-de-embedded NFs of 3.4dB and 4.1dB at 500MHz, respectively. OP1dB is 2dBm, and the power consumption is 1.7 to 3.6mW over 0.1 to 1GHz for both prototypes.",

      "abstract":"The electrical cochlear implants (Cls) have given > 500,000 patients worldwide a better life to date. However, the electrical neural stimulation has limited spatial resolution due to the spread of stimulation current, which reduces the number of effective channels to <; 10 and results in a restricted perception of sound. Recently developed CIs such as optogenetic Cls have overcome this limitation, enabling much higher effective channel count [1]. However, such CIs require much larger power consumption (>100mW) and a higher data transmission rate (>lMb/s) than conventional Cls. As a result, designing a simultaneous wireless power and data transfer (SWPDT) system becomes challenging. AIso, due to the short distance between transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) coils separated only by a scalp, frequency splitting may occur, and it should be carefully considered.",

      "abstract":"A near-threshold power supply aims to operate at the minimal energy point but suffers from high-sensitivity to process, temperature and voltage variations. Adaptive voltage scaling (AVS) is a well-known strategy to adapt the power supply to die-to-die and temperature variations [1]. However, AVS needs dedicated power supplies with nonnegligible overheads, e.g. extra die area, lower power converter efficiency, and with granularity limitations or complex fine-grain integration in the power mesh. SOI-based technologies offer unique features by biasing the wells below the transistors to tune the threshold voltage (VTH). The well-known adaptive back-biasing (ABB) technique has already shown its capability to reduce power consumption or/and maintain operating frequency by compensating VTH variability according to process corners and temperature [1-5]. However, previously published ABB architectures provide a limited overview on how to integrate the ABB seamlessly in the digital design flow with industrial-grade qualification. We propose a reusable ABB-IP for any biased digital load, from 0.4-100 mm2, with low area and power overhead, e.g. 1.2% @ 2mm2 and 0.4% @ 10mm2, respectively. We properly quantify the gain in a mass-production context with a large statistical scope analysis across 316 measured dies from different split-wafer lots and from -40 to 125°C with a representative load (a Cortex M4F). Thanks to 3V asymmetrical wells amplitude swing, our ABB-IP brings up to 30% power reduction by decreasing the minimal power supply by 100mV, while maintaining the target operating frequency (50 MHz) with a high yield. Distributed timing monitors (DTM) guarantee an accurate timing monitoring of the biased digital load, while scalable well drivers adjust to the biased well area, enabling the ABB-IP genericity.",

We have seen an emergence of quantum-computing activity in recent years from an uptick of startups to investments at established companies. Yet, there is more to quantum systems than simply computing. In fact, quantum systems by themselves do not work, and classical electronics are needed to interface with quantum devices. In this forum, we look at electronics, in particular CMOS electronics, for use in combination with quantum devices from the designer’s perspective. We explore these systems from specifications to testing, often at cryogenic temperatures, and discuss recent successes and future trends.",

      "abstract":"Digital-to-analog converter (DAC)-based transmitters are suited to support different modulation formats (e.g., NRZ, PAM-4, OFDM), long-channel equalization (incl. roaming taps) or even amplitude reduction for reflection mitigation at short channels. Compared to transmitters with a conventional FFE, a less complex and more uniform high-speed analog frontend can be designed in a DAC TX if the number of taps is large (e.g., >5) because the equalization is performed in the digital signal processing (DSP) unit running at sub-rate. However, this imposes the challenge of achieving low latency and power consumption, particularly at high resolution (e.g. 8b) and speed. The DAC TX presented here addresses these challenges with a table-based FFE approach with input gating of the combinatorial logic in the DSP. In the analog part of the DAC TX power reduction is achieved by utilizing metal gate poly resistors for compact layout with fewer parasitics and a DAC-weight unit scaling for reduced clock load. Across a full lot of 5 split wafers (FF, FS, TT, SF, SS) the measured power efficiency at 100Gb/s PAM-4 ranges from 1.30 to 1.42pJ/b at a supply voltage of 900mV with all FFE taps enabled.",

      "abstract":"This paper presents a scalable neural-network (NN) inference accelerator in 16nm, based on an array of programmable cores employing mixed-signal In-Memory Computing (IMC), digital Near-Memory Computing (NMC), and localized buffering/control. IMC achieves high energy efficiency and throughput for matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs), which dominate NNs; but, scalability poses numerous challenges, both technologically, going to advanced nodes to maintain gains over digital architectures, and architecturally, for full execution of diverse NNs. Recent demonstrations have explored integrating IMC in programmable processors [1, 2], but have not achieved IMC efficiency and throughput for full executions. The central challenge is drastically different physical design points and associated tradeoffs incurred by IMC compared to digital engines. Namely, IMC substantially increases compute energy efficiency and HW density/parallelism, but retains the overheads of HW virtualization (state and data swapping/buffering/communication across spatial/temporal computation mappings). The demonstrated architecture is co-designed with SW-mapping algorithms (encapsulated in a custom graph compiler), to provide efficiency across a broad range of mapping strategies, to overcome these overheads.",

      "abstract":"Amplifiers often employ chopping to achieve low offset and low-frequency noise. However, the interaction between the input signal and the chopper clock can cause chopper-induced intermodulation distortion (IMD) [1] -[5]. This is especially problematic for input frequencies (Fin) near even multiples of the chopping frequency (FCH), as the resulting IMD tones fold-back to low frequencies and so cannot be filtered out. In [2] -[4], spread-spectrum clocks are used to convert such tones into noise-like signals. However, this increases the noise floor and does not address the underlying problem. This paper shows that chopper-induced IMD is mainly due to amplifier delay, which results in large chopping spikes. A novel fill-in technique is proposed that mitigates these spikes, and so reduces the chopper-induced IMD. In a prototype chopper-stabilized amplifier, it reduces the chopper-induced IMD by 28dB, resulting in an IMD of -126dB for input frequencies near 4FCH (=80kHz). Similarly, it improves the chopped amplifier's two-tone IMD (79 and 80kHz) from -97dB to -107dB, thus maintaining the same IMD as the un-chopped amplifier.",

However, robust deep learning (DL) model accuracy equivalent to high-precision computation must be maintained. Improvements in bandwidth, architecture, and power management are also required to harness the benefit of reduced precision by feeding and supporting more parallel engines to achieve high sustained utilization and optimize performance within a given product power envelope. In this work, we present a 4-core AI chip in 7nm EUV technology that exploits cutting-edge algorithmic advances for iso-accurate models in low-precision training and inference [1, 2] and aggressive circuit/architecture optimization to achieve leading-edge power-performance. The chip supports fp16 (DLFIoat16 [8]) and hybrid-fp8(hfp8) [1] formats for training and inference of DL models, as well as int4 and int2 formats for highly scaled inference.",

      "abstract":"Optogenetics is a technique that involves the use of light to excite or inhibit neurons that have been genetically modified to express light-sensitive ion channels (opsins). Implanted LEDs or optical fibers are the most common approaches in optogenetic stimulation systems, but their broad illumination and lack of beam steering capability make them insufficient for probing individual neurons. When a 3D scanning optical system is used to control the position of a laser spot, single-cell precision can be achieved in a volume of tissue containing millions of cells. Due to the sub-ms response time of modern opsins and a demand for high throughput neural stimulation, a random-access scanning system requires a kHz refresh rate, and the capability to dwell on a target depth for an arbitrary length of time. Existing lateral (XY) scanning tools are fast, however state-of-the-art axial (Z) scanning technologies such as electrically tunable lenses (ETLs) and liquid crystal (LC) lenses are limited to <; 3ms settling times. Alternative axial scanning tools either lack dwelling capability or have impractical actuator drive requirements. We propose an axial focusing device comprised of an ASIC and phase modulating piston-motion MEMS mirrors with settling times <;100ps [6] enabling a 10kHz refresh rate. The driver ASIC is capable of addressing MEMS process variations that impact voltage-to-2 displacement behavior by employing a nonlinear, reconfigurable 6-bit DAC to achieve a f2linear input code-to-displacement response. We combine the driver with a 23,852-element MEMS array wired as 32 independently addressable rings to demonstrate high-speed axial (Z) focusing capability. The ASIC also has a 200x200 pixel array with a pad openings that can drive 40,000 independent MEMS mirrors at a 10kHz refresh rate 'to serve as a development platform for a MEMS mirror-based spatial light modulator (SLM), which would unify all three axes of scanning in a single, integrated device and rz would enable high-speed 3D optogenetic control of up to thousands of neurons",

Inaccuracies better than ±500ppm from -45°C to 85°C have been achieved, but typically at the expense of a costly and time-consuming 2-point trim to compensate for RC spread and temperature dependence. This paper describes a 16MHz RC-based frequency reference that achieves ±400ppm inaccuracy over the industrial temperature range with a single room-temperature (RT) trim. The prototype draws 88μA from a 1.8V supply and occupies 0.14mm2, which represents a 2× improvement in both power and area compared to the state of the art [2].",

      "abstract":"The advent of genetically encoded voltage and calcium indicators and optogenetic probes has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, including near-single-action-potential recording and stimulation with cell-type specificity. Optical functional imaging and optogenetics are delegated today primarily to large and expensive microscopes based on free-space optics. Integrating the microscope functionality into an implantable form factor remains an elusive goal. As a first step towards developing such a device, a variety of head-mounted “miniscopes” have been demonstrated [1]. Using conventional lens-based optics, however, these devices consume considerable volume (more than 2cm3) to support field of views (FoVs) of sub-mm 2. To achieve a truly implantable microscope, a more volume-efficient device is necessary that spans a relatively large cortical area while maintaining a minimally-invasive form factor.",

      "abstract":"Today's miniLED displays can be divided into multiple arrays. Each miniLED array with 900 pixels can have 60 channels where each channel has 15 LEDs connected in series. To drive multi-channel miniLEDs in parallel from a low input voltage VIN (= 6V), a boost converter with high output voltage (up to 30V) and high output current (up to 1.2A for 2000 nits) is required where the conversion ratio (CR=VOUT/VIN) is 5. Since the inductor current IL = ILOAD / (1-D) of the conventional 2-switch (2S) boost converter is high, where ILOAD is the load current and D is the duty cycle, 2S boost converters have low efficiency and high output voltage ripple. Although the boost converter assisted by a series flying capacitor CF can reduce the inductor current level to improve efficiency [1-5], CF lacks energy under high CR and high loading conditions. At the top of Fig. 17.9.1, both techniques in [1] and [2] charge the CF during φ2. In case of high CR, the duration of φ2 becomes small to seriously affect the charging time. Hence, due to insufficient charge stored in CF, the driving capability will decrease. At no load (left of Fig. 17.9.2), [1] fails to regulate and D is 0.87 in [2] to have CR=5. Interestingly, both [1] and [2] fail to have CR=5 at load current=1.2A. Although additional dual channel-interleaved three-level buck-boost (DTLBB) structure in [1] can alternatively charge two flying capacitors, the hardware overhead is double and the quiescent current becomes high.",

      "abstract":"To maximize data-rates by combining more carrier components, 5G RF transceivers require many carrier frequencies, resulting in the situation of many LC PLLs occupying a large silicon area. Ring-oscillator-based digital PLLs (RO-DPLLs) with a fractional resolution obviously can be a good solution, but conventional ΔΣM-based PLLs hardly achieve a low enough jitter to satisfy the requirements of high-order modulations, such as 256-QAM. Currently, the use of a digital-to-time converter (DTC) to cancel the quantization noise (Q-noise) is popular, but fractional spurs due to the nonlinearity of the DTC (NLDTC) are a critical problem, especially for RO-DPLLs that require a wide bandwidth to suppress the RO jitter. The piecewise linearization of the DTC code can compensate for this NLDTC [1], but its effectiveness has a tradeoff with design resources. The time-invariant probability modulation (TIPM) [2] at the top of Fig. 32.1.1 is another method to cope with NLDTC. It uses a property that, if the DTC code is modulated such that its probability density function (PDF) is time-invariant (TI), the expected value of the output is constant even after experiencing NLDTC so that the generation of fractional spurs can be avoided. However, since the TIPM avoids spurs by spreading out their noise power, it cannot reduce the rms jitter (or IPN) itself. Moreover, the TIPM is valid only for NLDTC since its TI property is nullified when the two DTC paths are merged. Therefore, it is still vulnerable to the spurs caused by the interaction of the Q-noise, which could remain after the DTCs or be coupled directly through substrate/supply, with the nonlinearities of other circuits (NLOC), and that includes the effects of parasitics and bond wires. The bottom of Fig. 32.1.1 shows that the TIPM effectively avoids spurs due to NLDTC, but the IPN remains the same (left). When NLOC also is applied (middle), the expected value of the TDC output, DTDC, varies over time, generating fractional spurs at SOUT.",

      "abstract":"The ever-increasing Internet data demand imposes stringent requirements on wireline transceiver speed, jitter, and power. A low-noise, multi-phase clock generator (MPCG) is a crucial building block in both forwarded-clock and clock-data-recovery (CDR) based clocking systems (Fig. 11.4.1). In CDR-based systems, a global phase-locked loop generates a low-noise, differential clock and distributes it to each lane, where a local phase adjuster, consisting of a multi-phase clock generator and phase interpolators (PIs), compensates the frequency and phase errors between the incoming data and quadrature clocks; while in a forwarded-clock system, the forwarded clock from the transmitter is adjusted by a delay line for phase deskew and the MPCG generates multiple phases for the ADCs. Multi-phase injection-locked ring oscillators (MPILOSCs) [1,2] provide accurate, low-noise, multi-phase clocks thanks to their wide locking range and symmetric structure, but generating the multi-phase injection signals with a poly-phase filter [1] or from a double/quadruple frequency [2] is power-hungry. Also, the circuits in [1,2] lack calibration for ROSC free-running frequency (fosc) variations over PVT. Two-phase (0° and 180°) IL-ROSCs with a quadrature-locked loop (OLL) are low-power, low-area MPCGs for PIs [3-5]; differential clocks are injected into the ROSC, while the OLL adjusts the ROSC biasing to suppress the IO output error, assuming that when the fosc = finj, the injection frequency, the smallest IO output error and the widest ROSC noise suppression bandwidth are obtained for a given injection strength. However, simulations (Fig. 11.4.2) show that the smallest IO error occurs when fosc is near the lower edge of the locking range due to the imbalance introduced by two-phase injection, while the optimum jitter point remains at fosc = finj. As a result, when using a OLL, the injection strength has to be increased to get a sufficiently large noise suppression bandwidth. However, the stronger injection degrades the amplitude and slope balance between stages with injection, and stages without injection, which degrades the phase accuracy. In a OLL-based architecture, there is a tradeoff among IO accuracy, jitter, and power consumption.",

      "abstract":"Bio-impedance (BioZ) is an important physiological parameter in wearable healthcare sensing. Besides the inherent cardiac and respiratory information, BioZ can be also used for other emerging applications such as non-invasive blood status sensing [1]. A conventional 4-electrode (4E) setup eliminates the effect of electrode-tissue impedance (ETI) at the expense of user comfort, system complexity, and cost. On the other hand, a 2-electrode (2E) setup avoids short-falls of 4E but can only capture relative changes of BioZ instead of its absolute value. In addition, a readout front-end (RFE) with wide dynamic range (DR) and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is needed to deal with small BioZ variation (0.1~10Ω) as well as large baseline resistance (>10kΩ). A conventional RFE architecture employing an instrumentation amplifier (IA) and ADC has to trade-off between resolution, DR and noise [2,3]. Although flicker noise in the current generator (CG) is mitigated through dynamic element matching (DEM) [2], the reference current (IREF) noise issue remains unaddressed. In [5], digital-assisted baseline cancellation and IREF correlated noise cancellation are proposed, which help eliminate IREF noise and input-dependent noise [4] due to the large signal in the current-balance instrumentation amplifier (CBIA). Nevertheless, larger noise is still observed due to the finite residual current (Ires) from the baseline cancellation.",

Low-cost100Gb/s PAM-4 optical transceivers are critical to spur their adoption in high volume by data centers. While low-cost integrated silicon-photonic 100Gb/s PAM-4 transmitters have been demonstrated recently, the electronics in current receiver solutions is more disaggregated. They typically employ a standalone BiCMOS TIA 1C followed by a 100G PAM-4 (ADC+DSP)-based SerDes 1C (designed to equalize high-loss electrical channels), which results in higher power dissipation and package cost. To address these drawbacks, we present a 100Gb/s PAM-4 optical RX with a single-chip Solution integrating all 0f the RX electronics in a bulk CMOS process. While standalone l00Gb/s PAM-4 CMOS linear TIAs have been shown in prior work [2], [3], their integration with subsequent SerDes has not yet been demonstrated.",

      "abstract":"The diversity of compute-intensive applications in modern cloud data centers has driven the explosion of GPU-accelerated cloud computing. Such applications include AI deep learning training and inference, data analytics, scientific computing, genomics, edge video analytics and 5G services, graphics rendering, and cloud gaming. The A100 GPU introduces several features targeting these workloads: a 3rd-generation Tensor Core with support for fine-grained sparsity, new BFIoat16 (BF16), TensorFIoat-32 (TF32), and FP64 datatypes, scale-out support with multi-instance GPU (MIG) virtualization, and scale-up support with a 3rd-generation 50Gbps NVLink I/0 interface (NVLink3) and NVSwitch inter-GPU communication. As shown in Fig. 3.2.1, A100 contains 108 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs) and 6912 CUDA cores. The SMs are fed by a 40MB L2 cache and 1. 56TB/s of HBM2 memory bandwidth (BW). At 1.41GHz, A100 provides an effective peak 1248T0PS (8b integers), 624TFLOPS (FP16) and312TFLOPS (TF32) when including sparsity optimizations. Implemented in a TSMC 7nm N7 process, the A100 die (Fig. 3.2.7) contains 54B transistors and measures 826mm2.",

      "abstract":"Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. The forum provides a comprehensive full-stack (hardware and software) view of ML acceleration from cloud to edge. The first talk focuses on the main design and benchmarking challenges facing large general-purpose accelerators, including multi-die scaling, and describes strategies for conducting relevant research as the complexity gap between research prototype and product continues to widen. The second talk looks at how to leverage and specialize the open-source RISC-V ISA for edge ML, exploring the trade-offs between different forms of acceleration such as lightweight ISA extensions and tightly-coupled memory accelerators. The third talk details an approach based on a practical unified architecture for ML that can be easily “tailored” to fit in different scenarios ranging from smart watches, smartphones, autonomous cars to intelligent cloud. The fourth talk explores the co-design of hardware and DNN models to achieve state-of-the-art performance for real-time, extremely energy/throughput-constrained inference applications. The fifth talk deals with ML on reconfigurable logic, discussing many examples of forms of specializations implemented on FPGAs and their impact on potential applications, flexibility, performance and efficiency. The sixth talk describes the software complexities for enabling ML APIs for various different types of specialized hardware accelerators (GPU, TPUs, including EdgeTPU). The seventh talk look into how to optimize the training process for sparse and low-precision network models for general platforms as well as next-generation memristor-based ML engines.",

      "abstract":"Ultra-low-power (ULP) receivers are gaining traction in consumer and industrial IoT solutions as standards such as WiFi 802.11ba, BLE, and NB-IoT have adopted wakeup messages into their protocols to reduce synchronization energy overhead. ULP wakeup receivers (WRX) enable lower average power, lower latency, and precise time synchronization which leads to more dense network deployments [1-5]. This paper presents a 2.7μW WRX that supports a simplified 802.15.4g MAC/PHY baseband, RSSI and clear channel assessment (CCA), forward error correction (FEC), and cryptographic checksum. The novelty of this WRX is the parallel-path rectifier and charge-domain analog front-end (AFE), which provides low power, wide dynamic range, pulsed interference rejection, and reliable operation across harsh environments and industrial wireless conditions in real-world deployments.",

      "abstract":"A continuous-time delta-sigma modulator (CT-DSM) ADC is commonly used in audio applications because of its high energy efficiency and driving-friendly front-end compared with its discrete time counterpart. A resistive DAC (R-DAC) is widely used for its intrinsic low flicker noise. However, the design of a high PSRR and low flicker noise reference generator for R-DAC not only consumes extra power and area with an external RC filter [1] but also limits the peak SNDR performance [2]. In contrast, a current-steering DAC (I-DAC) has intrinsic PSRR. In addition, the use of a tri-level implementation with a dumped buffer reduces noise with a small input signal, which improves dynamic range (DR), but flicker noise from the bias circuit still limits the peak SNR of the ADC. Instead of using large-sized transistors or an off-chip RC filter for required low flicker noise, the sample-and-hold noise filter [3] is proposed for a low noise I-DAC by filtering the bias noise with an off-transistor-based filter, which requires periodic refreshing to compensate the bias voltage drift due to the gate-leakage current of the DAC cells. However, a trade-off between bias voltage drift and folded sampling noise of this technique limits its usage in more advanced technology because larger gate-leakage current is expected. In order to solve aforementioned problems, we introduce a CT-DSM ADC with a gate-leakage compensated off-transistor (GLCOT) based I-DAC bias noise filter without extra off-chip components which is suitable for true wireless stereo (TWS) applications. The ADC achieves 104.4dB DR and 100.6dB SNDR in 24kHz bandwidth while consuming 116μW. This corresponds to a Schreier FoMDR of 187.5dB and FoMSNDR of 183.7dB, respectively.",

      "abstract":"Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) is transforming healthcare worldwide as a diagnostic tool with the potential to significantly reduce the delay between symptom onset and initiation of therapy. Conventional POCUS systems are based on piezoelectric transducers and cable-connected electronics, which require a costly manufacturing process and usually come with an undesirably limited channel count. Such devices typically serve a specific subset of clinical applications, as imaging at different body parts calls for different ultrasound frequencies that are beyond the bandwidth of a single piezoelectric transducer. To enable whole-body imaging, multiple probes with different frequencies, apertures and beamforming (BF) methods are generally required. This further limits the affordability and accessibility of POCUS. Recent advances in micromachined ultrasound transducers (MUTs) have offered an alternative path to addressing these challenges. However, previous attempts to integrate MUTs with chips have been incomplete, neither solving the integration problem nor achieving full ultrasound processing capabilities.",

      "abstract":"With an explosive growth of data generated by various applications, one of the most important topics of the current era is to increase the storage capacity. The evolution from 2D planar NAND to 3D NAND enables the development of high-density storage by increasing the number of stacked word-lines (WLs) in a smaller footprint. The industry has moved beyond 96-stacked-WL and achieved a 128-stacked 3D NAND. A 128-stacked 3b/cell 3D NAND with a density of 7.8Gb/mm 2 was reported recently, based on a peripheral circuit under cell array (PUC) structure [1]. Nevertheless, due to the constant demand for increased density, 3D NAND faces the following challenges [2,3]: (1) a reduced PUC area due to an increasing WL stack, (2) increased load due to a higher number of stacks and a reduced spacing between WLs, (3) rising WL-channel capacitance due to an increasing number of strings, and (4) variation in the RC delay between WLs due to the non-uniformity of plug critical dimension (CD). Not only do these problems limit the density improvement of 3D NAND, but they also increase the WL rise time, which degrades read and write performance. This paper proposes the following techniques to overcome these challenges: (1) a 12-stage page buffer (PB) with one-to-one (1:1) PBUS(PB to cache connection bus), (2) a variable stage and frequency charge pump with a boosted local pump, (3) center X-decoder (XDEC) and half-plane activation, (4) an unselected string boosting scheme, and (5) adaptive WL overdrive (OVD). By applying these techniques, we achieved a density of 10.8Gb/mm 2 in a 176stacked 3D NAND using 3b/cell.",

      "abstract":"Interest in ultra-high-speed wireline communications targeting 100Gb/s+ is rapidly increasing to accommodate the massive data traffic of data centric systems such as Internet-of-things, autonomous driving, cloud computing, etc. In recent publications, a 14GHz LC-PLL was successfully demonstrated for 112Gb/s PAM-4 transmitter clocking [1-3]. To extend the data rate to 224Gb/s, a 28GHz LC-PLL can be adopted instead of increased interleaving or use of higher-order modulation (PAM-8/16). However, doubling the PLL clock frequency without jitter or power penalties is challenging because doubling the data rate requires a 50% jitter reduction while CML-to-CMOS buffer and prescaler divider have increasing power overhead as they are pushed closer to millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequency ranges. This paper presents a 23.9-to-29.4GHz digital LC-PLL architecture that achieves a 65fs random jitter measured at a transmitter output with 17.1mW power consumption. The proposed design uses: 1) a current re-use coupled frequency doubler oscillator to improve phase noise by 4.5dB compared to a conventional LC-DCO with only a 25% power increase; 2) an automatic frequency-tracking loop (FTL) to optimize the phase noise of the frequency doubler across PVT; and 3) power saving by avoiding the prescaler divider operating in mm-wave frequencies.",

      "abstract":"Energy harvesting is an attractive solution to extend battery lifetime in a wireless sensor node (WSN). However, energy harvesting resources are inherently sporadic and critically affected by their environment, mandating energy storage elements (e.g., battery or super-capacitor) to guarantee a reliable operation. Recent studies that use energy storage elements mainly focus on efficient power extraction from the harvesting sources [1] -[5]. With many WSNs, the required amount of power during the sensing mode is small but increases significantly, often much higher than the instantaneous harvesting power, during the wireless data transmission. Therefore, the WSN cannot function properly with a simple boost converter topology with a limited output capacitor, and even it wastes energy under light load condition [1]. Thus, a storage element is required in the cases of remaining topologies [2] -[5]. In a 2-stage cascaded boost and buck converter topology, the boost converter harvests continuously to the storage element and load is supplied from the storage element, but the cascaded operation of the boost and buck converter leads to a poor overall efficiency [2]. A discontinuous energy harvesting mode is introduced in [4], [5] to address the above issues. However, during the storage element powered mode, the output voltage could be seriously unregulated when the stored energy is directly transferred to the output [4]. Besides, there still remains an inefficiency concern as the system stops collecting energy from the harvesters during the storage element powered mode [4], [5]. This work presents a reconfigurable DC-DC converter for maximum thermoelectric generator (TEG) energy harvesting in a battery-powered WSN. The converter operates in single-input dual-output (SIDO) boost and battery-supplied buck modes with a single inductor achieving 88.5% peak end-to-end and 93.3% efficiencies, respectively. Battery-TEG pile-up buck (BTPB) and dual-phase buck/boost (DPBB) modes are proposed to maximize the TEG power extraction during the battery-powered operation, resulting in up to 44% saving in the battery power.",

Ripple domino circuitry relies on rail-to-rail readout, which forces a trade off between performance and the number of 8T cells on a local read bit line (RBL). To support larger array sizes, without sacrificing performance, arrays are segmented, and several segments are stitched to form the full array. Each segment requires local evaluation circuitry to connect local BL to global BLs. This local circuitry, along with the required layout fencing of each segment results in poor array efficiency.",

      "abstract":"The small wavelength and non-ionizing nature of EM waves in the THz spectrum make this frequency band attractive for high-resolution imaging applications. While amplitudebased THz imaging systems have already been demonstrated in Silicon [1], an integrated solution for phase detection in this frequency range has not been reported so far. Detecting the phase change of THz waves passing through the imaged object would enable applications like high-precision thickness measurement and dielectric permittivity characterization. Furthermore, phase-contrast imaging techniques allow scanning of weakly absorbing materials, such as soft tissues and polymers, where amplitude-based scanners are incapable of providing clear pictures [2]. However, the mentioned applications demand high phase-detection accuracy, imposing strict SNR requirements on THz phase imagers for real-time operation. The main SNR limitation of such systems comes from the high NF of the THz receivers [3,4], due to the lack of an LNA prior to downconversion of the THz signal. This paper proposes a two-step IQ downconversion RX architecture with low-loss LO power combining as a way to alleviate the mentioned problem, achieving RX NF of 27dB at 420GHz. Additionally, it presents a frequencylocked TX that achieves 10dBm EIRP, leading to 52dB SNR (100kHz RBW) of the TX-RX coherent imaging system when operating at a distance of 25cm. This system demonstrates 420GHz phase detection with RMS accuracy of 2.8° and RMS 1σ precision of 1.7°.",

      "abstract":"Subsampling PLLs (SSPLLs) are attractive architectures to generate ultra-low-jitter RF signals due to their intrinsically high phase-error-detection gain, KSH. However, this high-gain operation of a sample-and-hold circuit (SH) also has a downside that makes it difficult to achieve a fractional resolution. This is because the quantization error (Q-error) due to the non-integer relationship between the reference frequency, fREF, and the VCO frequency, fVCO, easily makes sampling points fall outside the linear range of the SH. Thus, to have a fractional resolution, SSPLLs must have a dedicated method for cancelling the Q-error. The top left of Fig. 32.4.1 shows a time-domain Q-error cancellation (TD-QEC) that is currently popular [1]. As a digital-to-time converter (DTC) cancels the Q-error, the VCO output, SVCO, can be continuously sampled at high-KSH points in the steady state. However, a critical problem is that, since the DTC is located at the front, its thermal noise cannot be suppressed by KSH degrading the in-band phase noise (PN) of SSPLLs. In contrast, in reference-sampling PLLs (RSPLLs) [2,3], the divided signal of the SVCO samples the reference clock, SREF. However, they have a fundamental limit to achieve a low jitter since their KSH is much smaller than that of SSPLLs while the thermal noise of the DTC is still high.",

      "abstract":"Power is a major bottleneck in AIoT devices, which usually operate in random-sparse-event (RSE) scenarios [1] (Fig. 12.1.1, bottom). To process RSEs energy-efficiently, one can integrate an always-on wake-up chip [1-5] that only turns on the power-hungry high-performance system (HPS) once valid events are detected. Previous dedicated voice-activity-detection (VAD) wake-up chips using analog front-ends (AFE) followed by neural-network (NN) circuits consume 1μW [2] and 142nW [3]. Keyword spotting (KWS) wake-up, which is more complicated than VAD, can be achieved by an NN engine at 510nW [4], but it needs an off-chip power-hungry 16b ADC to drive its digital input. For general purpose, an event-driven wake-up chip [1] consumes 57nW. But without an intelligent inference engine (IIE), false detection due to invalid events will consume excessive power. The IIE can be realized by a finite-state-machine (FSM) pattern recognition circuit but with massive 2.2μW [5]. This work, to our best knowledge, presents a first reported event-driven intelligent wake-up chip that achieves ultra-low power and intelligent event detection for various AIoT RSEs.",

      "abstract":"IoT transceiver deployments are envisioned to have low power, low data-rate (~kb/s) wake-up receive (WuRX) and Mb/s primary receive (RX) modes for long battery lifetimes [1]. WuRX architectures based on energy-detection (ED) achieve ultra-low power (ULP) consumption but have poor sensitivities (~ -60 to -40dBm) for <; 1ms latency [2-5] and are susceptible to modulated interferers without passive high-Q RF filtering [6-9]. While modulated-interferer tolerance is critical for practical deployments, high-Q RF filtering severely limits operating frequency range, making it challenging to operate across region-specific spectrum allocations and temperature/process variations. Mixer-first uncertain-IF RX can potentially improve operating frequency range and interferer tolerance [10]. However, if the relatively high NF is mitigated using frequency-selective passive RF voltage gain, frequency operation range is again limited. Finally, the antenna must be shared between the primary RX, WuRX and potentially the TX in such ULP radios making it challenging to share the high-Q WuRX matching network with the fullband primary radio. This paper presents a low-power hybrid-coupler based mixer-first noise-cancelling RX that supports a wideband shared antenna interface for the primary and WuRX while also providing passive voltage gain and achieves (i) wide LO-defined operating bandwidth (0.75GHz to 1GHz) in both primary and wake-up modes, (ii) interferer-tolerance for the wake-up RX ( >26dB Signal-to-Interference Ratio (SIR) at 2MHz offset for 4Mb/s QPSK interferer) and high-linearity in the primary RX (0.75dBm IP1dB) and (iii) high-sensitivity in both wake-up (-86dBm) and primary RX (3.8dB NF) modes through noise cancelling, while consuming 171uW in wake-up RX mode (including RF LO) and 440uW in primary RX mode.",

The advances in high-precision analog front-end and data conversion circuits have opened up new opportunities in diverse application spaces. To keep fueling the evolution of emerging applications, such as health monitoring, industry 4.0, and internet of things, advanced sensing technology is required to further improve resolution, speed, as well as power and area efficiency of the system. This forum highlights the fundamental challenges with an emphasis on techniques to achieve the ultimate accuracy in analog circuits and data converters. Following an overview of analog-circuit challenges, a series of discussions start with essential high-accuracy voltage and frequency references along with the compensation techniques for their long-term drift, and then move on to the system-level functions of high-precision amplifiers, digital-to-analog converters, as well as overasampling and Nyquist-rate analog-to-digital converters, which are required to construct the overall signal chain.",

      "abstract":"Ring oscillator (RO)-based frequency synthesizers enable cost-efficient and scaling-friendly implementation, but also result in worse phase noise compared to LC-based alternatives. There has been increasing interest in injecting a low-noise reference clock signal to the RO to refresh the accumulated jitter, as seen in multiplying delay-locked loops (MDLLs) and injection-locked phase-locked loops (1L-pLLs). The main challenge of this architecture is that the injection signal derived from the reference clock is not perfectly aligned with the RO phase at the injection node, hence spurious tones are generated, and this phase alignment issue is especially exacerbated in fractional-N 0peration as the injection time paint must gradually drift away from the reference clock phase [1]. One way of achieving this required phase drift is by tuning digital-to-time converters (DTCs) according to a fractional frequency multiplication ratio; however, DTC offset and gain errors can introduce spurs. Several works have demonstrated DTC calibration, but are either limited to foreground calibration or incur an additional time-to-digital converter (TDC) [2], [3]. To further suppress injection-locking-induced spurs, we propose a background DTC calibration scheme that: 1) simultaneously estimates DTC gain and offset errors by occasional injection squelching; 2) performs two-point gain and offset error correction in the respective analog and digital domains; 3) uses TDC dithering [4] to enhance error estimation accuracy; and 4) removes dithering noise with an adaptive comb-filter-assisted cancellation loop. To prove the concept, a fractional-N digital MDLL using the DTC calibration scheme is implemented in 65nm CMOS and demonstrates 1.67ps RMS jitter and -60dBc fractional spur with 26dB spur suppression.",

      "abstract":"A compact, low-power, low-jitter clock system supporting multiple output frequencies is required in many applications. Using several PLLs to generate multiple frequencies consumes large power and chip area [1]. Alternatively, fractional output dividers (FODs) can be employed (Fig. 29.1.5, top) to generate multiple outputs [2]-[5]. In an FOD, the fractional division is realized by dithering a multi-modulus divider (MMD). The digital-to-time converter (DTC) is used to compensate for the quantization error due to dithering. However, the DTC characteristic is PVT sensitive and requires calibration to mitigate the variation. Prior work adopted additional replica DTCs to realize the DTC gain calibration [2]. Since DTC often dominates power and area in an FOD design, extra DTCs lead to large power and area penalties [2], [3]. Furthermore, mismatch among replica and main DTCs degrades FOD performance.",

      "abstract":"Analog techniques continue to push the frontiers of precision, power, and performance. This year’s edition features two amplifiers and two accurate, temperature insensitive frequency references. The first paper describes a closed-loop, filter-less Class-D headphone amplifier that achieves the best output efficiency with low-power operation. The second paper pushes the state-of-the-art with the highest energy efficiency and lowest area. The third paper describes another low-power, low-area frequency reference that requires only a single-point trim to cover the entire industrial temperature range. Lastly, the final paper achieves the lowest chopper-induced intermodulation distortion (IMD) of -125.9dB ever reported.",

      "abstract":"High-performance SerDes with both high area efficiency (mm2/lane) and energy efficiency (pJ/b) are driven by the ever-increasing demands of bandwidth and capacity in data centers. They also enable chiplets, multi-die, and silicon-photonics integration for a low cost, high yield, and high throughput solution. Besides, low-power SerDes is essential to overall system power savings by reducing the power overhead and cost for cooling. This session introduces advanced wireline techniques that support both high-speed and energy-efficient data transmission over electrical, fiber, and dielectric waveguide channels. The first three papers of the session describe short-reach power- and density-optimized transceivers in state-of-the-art 7nm FinFET technology. The next two describe low-power clock generators for high-speed transceivers. The remaining four papers of the session focus on design solutions to enable future high-speed link scaling, including optical and dielectric waveguides, ultra-low power CDRs, and the potential for >50Gb/s simultaneous, bidirectional signaling over high-loss channels.",

      "abstract":"The Internet-of-Things (IoT) requires dense sensor networks with low-latency response from wireless devices that operate on severely limited power budgets. Integrated wakeup receivers (WuRX) contribute to this vision by enabling event-driven, energy-efficient connectivity, but they must provide similar sensitivity and interferer tolerance as the main receiver at much lower power. Recent WuRX work has pushed operation into the multi-GHz range, including the 2.4GHz ISM band, but it shows the challenge of simultaneously realizing high sensitivity, high selectivity, and near-μW average power (Pavg) at average latency (Lavg) of milliseconds. A 2.4GHz Envelope-Detector (ED)-first topology WuRX [1] achieved 236nW at a limited sensitivity of -56.5dBm. A -99dBm Tuned-RF WuRX achieved 2.17μW with duty-cycled 61dB RF gain at 434MHz [2], but high gain can lead to instability and limited interference tolerance at multi-GHz. An Uncertain-IF (U-IF) WuRX achieved sensitivity of -97dBm and signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) of -31dB at 99μW [3] by adopting off-chip inductors, which increases integration volume. A duty-cycled heterodyne WuRX demonstrated -92dBm sensitivity at 4.4μW [4], but at 1s latency which can be undesirable for large-scale networks.",

IC technology enables such extreme miniaturization of the US imaging system, and high energy efficiency is one of the most critical features for form-factor reduction and image quality (e.g., frame rate) improvement. Typically, a pulser driving a US transducer is the most power-hungry block in US imaging systems due to the massive parasitic capacitance [2] of the transducer (Fig. 34.4.1).",

      "abstract":"The progress towards smaller Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) has expanded the applications for ubiquitous sensing. However, the form-factor of a WSN is typically limited by bulky off-chip components, mainly the crystal reference and antenna. Recent work has focused on removing the crystal by recovering the reference from a received RF signal [1], replacing the crystal with an external FBAR resonator [2], using an open-loop oscillator and compensating frequency drift at the gateway [3], or using an on-chip patch antenna for a reference [4]. This paper presents a fully integrated crystal-less TRX that supports node-to-node communication across 12 channels using an integrated transmission line as a reference to lock and tune the RF frequency. The integrated 3-port slot antenna supports TX and RX modes without a TRX switch. The on-off keyed (OOK)-based uncertain IF TRX architecture enables node-to-node communication with 16dB channel selectivity, with no external components required. The chip area is minimized by reusing the active area underneath the passive devices for baseband circuits.",

      "abstract":"Gallium-Nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) have the advantages of low parasitic capacitance, low on-resistance (RON), and no reverse recovery charge loss [1-5]. Thus, using GaN HEMTs one can optimize the performance of power integrated circuits. However, today's GaN HEMTs have serious process defects, especially depending on the selected substrate. A 650V GaN-on-Si structure is shown in Fig. 33.1.1, and there are severe heterogeneous defects between the GaN buffer layer and the Si substrate. Thus, temperature changes will seriously aggravate the hot carrier injection, and the two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) layer in the GaN HEMT will weaken over time. The on-resistance (RON) and threshold voltage (VTH,E) of 650 GaN HEMT gradually increase, and in turn, rapidly decline the reliability. Although state-of-the-art gate drivers can effectively reduce the ringing at the VGS of the GaN switch [4-6], the temperature reliability problem still exists. The tri-slope gate control in [4] adjusts the sourcing current IControl to drive the gate voltage VG. The active slew-rate control method in [6] uses different gate resistors RG1 and RG2 to control the driving current IG. Both control techniques did not consider temperature-dependent threshold voltage. To completely reduce parasitic effects, monolithic integration of gate driver and GaN HEMT in GaN-on-Si process has been shown in [3, 7]. However, they did not carefully consider the reliability degradation caused by the variations of VTH,E and Miller plateau voltage due to temperature effects. High switching operations enlarge the temperature effect on monolithic integration.",

      "abstract":"Physically unclonable functions (PUFs) have been actively investigated as a promising solution for low-cost secure authentication in Internet of Things (IoT) applications. A PUF should generate unique challenge-response pairs (CRPs) which need to be determined solely by process variations (which are unpredictable) with strong immunity to supply and temperature changes. A PUF requires intrinsically stable and reliable operation while keeping area small and power consumption low. Approaches using metastability can provide efficient operation with fast response [1], but they suffer from high sensitivity to noise, supply and temperature changes. To achieve better stability, circuits for amplification of process skew effects have been adopted in PUF cells. The two-transistor amplifier [2], NAND-gate [3] and current-starved inverter [4] have been proposed as static amplifiers for detection of process mismatch, achieving further improved stability, as well as fast response. However, these approaches mostly rely on the process variation of the first stage amplifier. Therefore, they eventually result in an inconsistent output affected by transient noise when the process variation of the first stage amplifier is small.",

      "abstract":"The mm-wave spectrum is opening a new opportunity for TRx systems to operate at high-Gb/s data-rates. However, this opportunity is also imposing stringent requirements for power amplifiers (PAs) in terms of efficiency and linearity. To this date, all PA designs focus on increasing the peak/power-back-off (PBO) PAE and output power (max Pout) by either presenting multi-harmonic terminations or improving on existing topologies, such as stacked, outphasing, and Doherty PAs [1-3]. However, in highly scaled silicon processes with low supply voltages, these reported techniques see diminishing returns on PAE and Pout since the transistor knee voltage (Vknee) becomes a significant portion of the supply voltage [5]. Moreover, an extra reduction in supply voltage is often performed in practical deployment to ensure device reliability. This is especially relevant for mm-wave array operations, where array element couplings result in substantial antenna impedance mismatches and undesired large PA voltage swings [6]. Although the reported techniques have improved overall PA efficiency at mm-wave, fundamentally they are incapable of surpassing the theoretical PA core efficiency at the same conduction angle (e.g., Class-B common-source (CS) PA) without resorting to device switching, or harmonic shaping.",

      "abstract":"Recently, digital transmitters (DTXs) that feature arrays of controlled digital PA (DPA) cells have become increasingly popular since they directly benefit from nanoscale CMOS technology, yielding reduced die area and highly efficient operation [1] -[6]. For wideband applications, I/Q DTXs are considered superior over their polar counterparts due to their linear I/Q operation, which avoids bandwidth expansion. Nevertheless, I/Q DTXs can suffer from the interaction between their I and Q paths, especially at higher power levels, giving rise to an I/Q image and nonlinearity. To tackle this issue, an IQ interleaved upconverter has been introduced [1]. However, its 25%-LO requirement restricts the operational frequency to below 5GHz. The diamond-shaped mapping technique, presented in [2], uses 50% LOs and a different I and Q combining method but suffers from nonlinearity due to a clipping operation. Besides, the large peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) in modern wireless standards requires the DTX to operate in deep power back-off (DPBO), degrading its average efficiency. To target applications requiring large modulation bandwidth, high spectral purity and average efficiency, we present a DTX with a signed IQ interleaved upconversion approach based on 50%-LO clock distribution, which enables close to perfect orthogonal I/Q summation. To enhance its average efficiency, a compact, 4-way Doherty DPA architecture is introduced.",

      "abstract":"Light-field (LF) refers to the spatio-directional light flow in space. In LF imaging, light rays are recorded along different positions and directions, and a 3-D scene is reconstructed with back-propagation [1]. Modern visible-light LF cameras assemble a lens array atop a megapixel (Mpx) count focal-plane array (FPA), such that each lens (macro-pixel) provides spatial sampling while the FPA pixels within a lens (sub-pixels) provide angular sampling [2]. Likewise, THz LF cameras can allow real-time 3D see-through imaging for inspection and screening applications [3]. Unfortunately, THz Mpx FPAs are infeasible as a large THz pixel area (>10× visible-light pixel) would require wafer-scale FPA fabrication, leading to impractical costs and process variations. Multi-chip packaging is an alternative for scaling the THz FPA pixel count, but it requires compact THz camera ICs with serial data interfaces (small pin count) to allow dense integration.",

      "abstract":"To suppress the gain error from dynamic-power amplifiers, recently presented approaches including gain-error shaping (GES) [1], digital amplifiers [2] and closed-loop dynamic amplifiers [3] are promising alternatives for calibrations. However, due to the high gain and stability requirements, it is difficult to run the closed-loop dynamic amplifier [3] at high speed. The digital amplifier [2] calls for a low-noise comparator, which is both power-inefficient and high-speed unfriendly. The GES shapes the inter-stage gain (ISG) error of the SAR-assisted pipeline ADC into high frequencies [1]. Nevertheless, its extra 1st stage DAC and digital error feedback significantly confines the overall pipelined speed. Rather than a dedicated effort to handle the ISG error, this paper explores an architectural approach that inherently tolerates it. We incorporate together the shaping of the gain and quantization errors, thereby omitting any additional feedback operations or hardware. Further, with the partial-interleaving (PI) 1st stage, the noise-shaping (NS) SAR-assisted pipeline ADC (N-0 MASH) runs at 400MHz with 25MHz bandwidth (BW). It demonstrates a gain-error tolerability in the 3dB-SNDR-deviation of -16% to + 12% from a nominal 75dB SNDR.",

      "abstract":"Summary form only given, as follows. The end of transistor scaling drives innovative 2.5D, 3D and chiplet technologies to further extend Moore’s law. Recent advancements in multi-die integration effectively reduce the costs at advanced nodes while providing more flexibility, modularity and heterogeneous integration, which require designers to rethink the system architectures to exploit these advantages. This forum focuses on the most recent advancements of the 2.5D, 3D and chiplet technologies as well as the key components for integration to enable new system architectures. This forum aims to bring together technologists, designers and architects from industry and academia to discuss the practical challenges and solutions in 2.5D/3D technologies, and to provide insights on how to leverage the technology benefits with different system requirements. The forum starts with an overview of foundry solutions on 2.5D, 3D and chiplets technologies, followed by deep dive topics inspired by application focuses. For example, FPGA with 2.5D/3D heterogeneous integration has emerged with promising data-centric applications. High-bandwidth memory (HBM) has been widely adopted in commercial processors, and yet advanced integration techniques and design strategies remain the key to overcome the practical challenges to satisfy power density and performance requirements. Recent advancements in chiplets rapidly evolves the design space in SoC, driving both cost reduction and modularity. Meanwhile, design considerations to address power delivery, signaling, and thermal challenges at the circuit level as well as advanced heterogeneous integration at the process level have attracted research interests and innovations to further improve the system-level efficiency and reliability in the multi-chip stacking era. Co-optimization of high-speed serial links with 2.5D/3D technologies plays another essential role to continuously improve off-chip communication and system performance. Moreover, driven by the growth of edge computing and advanced 3D stacking empowers sensor integration for latency reduction with near-sensor intelligence. Finally, the forum concludes with a hierarchical view of the 3D interconnect technology landscape and long-term roadmap, shedding light on future technology directions.",

      "abstract":"With the introduction of the Internet of Things (IoT), there is an increasing focus on human-to-machine interaction. Nowadays, sensors make system and robots to see, hear, feel, and intuitively “understand” their surroundings. 60GHz radar [1] provides a very attractive solution for the sensing of human motion, enabling specific use cases such as: smart presence, hand gesture, and vital signs monitoring. Those can enhance the user experience in wearables, mobile devices, TVs, smart homes, automotive infotainment systems and AR-VR applications. The high bandwidth allocated in the 60GHz band (from 57 to 64GHz) enables very high range resolution sensing (≈2cm), which, when complemented with micro-Doppler and time domain analysis [2], offers a powerful tool for discriminating complex hand movements with millimeter accuracy. The solution presented in this paper represents the a tiny radar system integrated into a smartphone, the Google Pixel 4. The simplified signal flow pipeline, from the radar sensor up to the signal transformation and classification, is presented in Fig. 2.3.1 [3]. The radar sensor is designed primarily taking into account all the integration boundaries, which includes in primis power consumption and package size (including antenna). Specifically, the power consumption requirement translates to a very stringent requirement for the maximum number of chirps the sensor could run per frame, impacting the process gain, and so the maximum detection range.",

      "abstract":"Electric vehicle battery chargers, solar-panel inverters, industrial power monitoring, and many other high voltage applications rely on magnetic sensors for contactless current sensing over shunt-based sensors due to inherent galvanic isolation [1-4]. Within magnetometers, integrated fluxgate (IFG) sensors provide nT resolution versus μT accuracy of Hall sensors [1-4]. To linearize IFG response, magnetic fields are balanced out in the core using large compensation currents at high fields, making them power hungry (>100mW for 2mT) [1,2]. Previous IFG sensors were designed for continuous operation at high sampling rates, but with long initial convergence time (200μs), preventing them from being duty cycled efficiently to reduce average power consumption at lower BW [2,5]. High power is prohibitive for many low-BW and coreless applications [6,7] that use an array of IFG sensors to achieve stray field rejection in order to save area, cost, and installation effort.",

      "abstract":"Millimeterwave (mm-Wave) radar sensors operating in the 76-to-81 GHz band are a key component of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) for enhanced automotive safety. The recent entry of CMOS solutions in this space has accelerated development of multi-mode Radars that can support long, medium and short-range applications [1-3]. As ADAS applications evolve to support higher levels of autonomy, there is increased demand on radar sensors for improved maximum range, velocity, and angular resolution. Emerging automotive in-cabin occupancy sensing applications are creating opportunities for short-range, high-resolution sensors operating in 60/77GHz bands (depending on the regulatory market). The unlicensed 60GHz band has also enabled industrial sensing opportunities across diverse markets such as robotics, building automation, and healthcare. Several of these broad-market applications require inexpensive and small form factor sensors that can be deployed on low cost PCBs (e.g., FR4) without expertise in mm-Wave design. In this paper, we describe our high-performance 76-to-81GHz FMCW Automotive Radar that supports multi-chip cascading to enable higher angular resolution and a compact 57-to-64 GHz single-chip Radar with integrated antennas on package. All devices are built on a 45nm bulk CMOS technology with 9 metal layers and packaged using flip-chip BGA technology.",

      "abstract":"Mixed-signal vision chips are becoming increasingly popular for low-power embedded computer vision applications on smartphones, wearables and IoT nodes, as they meet stringent power and area constraints while maintaining a sufficient level of accuracy for low- to medium-level image processing tasks. On the one hand, in-sensor processing [1, 2] enables massively parallel operation but relies on pixel-level processing elements that degrade the pixel pitch and restrict the convolutional receptive field to neighboring pixels [1], precluding multi-scale operation. On the other hand, near-sensor processing [3-5] can operate at multiple scales by pixel downsampling [3] or binning [4] but entails significant power and area overhead as an analog memory is required to store pixel values awaiting processing. In addition, previous near-sensor processing SoCs are generally application-specific and thus suffer from limited versatility. In this paper, we present a 65nm QQVGA convolutional imager SoC codenamed SleepSpotter capable of versatile feature extraction and region-of-interest (RoI) detection based on in-sensor current-domain MAC operations. It operates at 6 different scales, features programmable filter size (F), stride (S), and ternary filter weights (1.5b). It reaches a minimum energy of 2.5pJ/pixel-frame-filter and a peak efficiency of 3.6TOPS/W, with 29% pixel area overhead for enabling the convolution and without the need for an analog memory.",

      "abstract":"Wireline IOs have doubled per-lane data-rate every 3-4 years over the last two decades due to increasing demand in high-performance computing, networking/communications, and most recently from machine learning and AI. To address the need for higher throughput, this paper presents a 224Gb/s DAC-based PAM-4 TX with 8-tap FFE in 10nm CMOS technology. Doubling the data-rate from 112Gb/s while supporting the same PAM-4 modulation requires doubling the pad and internal net bandwidth and reducing the clocking jitter and circuit noise PSD by $2 \\times $ while maintaining swing, linearity, and reliability requirements. These are addressed by combining a low-noise on-chip LC-PLL, an inductive clock distribution network with jitter filtering, a two-stage 4:1 MUX with active peaking, and a group-delay-optimized output matching network for signal integrity.",

      "abstract":"The recent popularity of indoor-localization applications such as secure access and asset tracking has led to growing interest in accurate RF-based ranging solutions. Impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) is a promising solution for accurate ranging due to its wideband 0peration. The recently released IEEE 802. 15.4z standard [1] improves upon the security of ranging and mandates a coherent operation with higher mean pulse-repetition frequencies (mPRF), in comparison to the legacy standard IEEE 802. 15.4a. The next generation IR-UWB devices demand ultra-low-power operation while meeting the strict spectrum regulations to operate worldwide in C and X bands (4 to 10GHz). The prior-art coherent IR-UWB transmitters either consume very high power [2] or result in high spurious emissions in adjacent channels due to poor sidelobe suppression [3-6]. In this work, an asynchronous polar transmitter is proposed that consumes 4.9mW active power with an output power spectral density (PSD) of -41.3dBm/MHz and a sidelobe suppression of over 28dBrin IEEE 802. 15.4zl24.8MHzmPRF mode, channel 9 (7987.2MHz). Further, we demonstrate the use of an injection-locked ring oscillator (IL-R0) with fine-grained duty-cycling of the TX chain to achieve state-of-the-art power consumption for mPRFs from 3.9MHz to 124. 8MHz while maintaining coherent operation over the packet.",

      "abstract":"The emergence of the pandemic has demonstrated the necessity of point-of-care (POC) molecular diagnostic platforms that encompass an end-to-end system (from sample fluid to diagnostic information) with the ability to allow rapid analysis on the spot. While POC sensing technologies have been demonstrated in miniaturize chip-scale platforms, the bottlenecks in enabling end-to-end low-cost handheld platforms have often been bio-sample handling, filtering, mixing with re-agents that are critical to the robustness of the assay chemistry and sensing sensitivity/specificity. These processes are typically carried out either manually or by employing complex pneumatic flow control with multiple bulky syringe pumps, which have been a severe limitation to enable end-to-end biosensing systems (Fig. 18.2.1). While electrically driven droplets, molecular and cell manipulation techniques, such as electro-wetting, electrophoresis and dielectrophoresis, have been demonstrated in singular systems before, they do not have the ability to process bulk bio-sample fluids that is required for POC devices. In this paper, we present a scalable approach that merges the functionalities of sample processing and cellular/bio-molecular sensing in a single system and eliminates any pneumatic pumping mechanisms by exploiting CMOS-based electrically driven electro-kinetic flow of bulk fluids. We demonstrate, for the first time, a CMOS-microfluidic system that is capable of 1) pumping bulk electrolyte fluid with AC electro-osmosis, 2) cell manipulation and separation with dielectrophoresis (DEP), 3) label-free biomolecular and cell sensing, classification with dedicated 16-element impedance spectroscopy receivers. While we demonstrate these kernel functionalities in a multichip module/microfluidic interface (Fig. 18.2.1), the overall architecture, fluidics and sensing components can be massively scaled up for various POC applications due to elimination of pressure-driven flows (Fig. 18.2.1).",

      "abstract":"The demand for high-performance graphics systems used for artificial intelligence continues to grow; this trend requires graphics systems to achieve ever higher bandwidths. Enabling GDDR6 DRAM to achieve data rates beyond 18Gb/s/pin [1] requires identifying and solving factors that affect the speed of a memory interface. Prior studies have showed that the memory interface is vulnerable from the signal integrity (SI) and power integrity (PI) perspective, since it is based on a parallel interface using single-ended signaling. Furthermore, circuit schemes to mitigate process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations in sub-nanometer DRAM process are required to improve performance. To achieve 24Gb/s/pin on a 1.35V DRAM process, this work proposes a GDDR6 DRAM with a half-rate clocking architecture and optimized I/O.",

      "abstract":"In low-cost battery-less systems, capacitive sensing via capacitance-to-digital conversion (CDC) needs to operate with minimal or no support from additional circuitry such as voltage regulation, voltage/current references or digital post-processing as shown in Fig. 5.2.1 (e.g., for linearization). At the same time, direct harvesting demands operation down to very low voltages and power, to consistently fit the power available from the environment even when scarce (e.g., down to ~nW/mm2 in light harvesters under realistic conditions). To enable continuous monitoring at power lower than the μW-range of state-of-the-art ~12-bit CDCs [1-3], 7-to-8-bit architectures with power down to sub-nW have been demonstrated for sensor nodes [4], although their supply voltage requirement (≥0.6V) is not suitable for direct harvesting, similar to [5]. CDCs for continuous monitoring at lower resolution (~7 bit) with sub-nW operation at 0.6V have been also demonstrated [6], although their power is burdened by the additional contribution of digital post-processing (~nWs) and others. A fully digital CDC has been introduced in [7] in the form of capacitance-to-voltage conversion via capacitor linear discharge due to a ring oscillator and final voltage-to-digital conversion, which requires two supply voltages of 0.45V and 1V. Operation at minimal power also comes with measurement times in the sub-second or second scale [6,8] in addition to the reduced resolution, which are still in the range required by continuous monitoring in several applications [6,8] (e.g., temperature, humidity, proximity, fluid level monitoring).",

      "abstract":"The introduction of the fifth-generation (5G) New Radio (NR) standard has imposed several challenges in the design of sub-6GHz receivers (RX). Firstly, the maximum channel bandwidth(2BW) increases to 100MHz, while a -15dBm continuous-wave (CW) blocker can be located only Δf=85MHz away from the desired band edge. Such a small Δf/BW(~2) places a stringent linearity requirement on an RX, thus demanding the use of higher-order filtering. Secondly, in-band (IB) linearity also becomes critical, since the band of interest may contain many signals resulting from carrier aggregation and digital beamforming 0peration. Finally, a sub-3dB noise Figure (NF) is required to achieve the highest possible link budget, which allows to maximize the spectral efficiency and data rate.",

      "abstract":"A local oscillator (LO) for 5G new radio requires sub-100fs rms jitter to support 64-OAM and $2\\times2$ MIMO under non-ideal channel conditions [1]. Although fractional-N phase-locked loops (PLLs) employing digital-to-time converters (DTCs) and sampling phase detectors (SPDs) have demonstrated integrated jitter below 100fs [1, 2], such a DTC remains the most challenging block in this PLL architecture. It needs to achieve a fine resolution (e.g., 0.3ps) for low quantization noise (ON) and a large delay range to cancel the quantization error (OE) due to the delta-sigma modulator (DSM) used for fractional-N synthesis (e.g., 400ps for a5GHz VCO and mash1-1 DSM). The DTC also contributes to the in-band phase noise (PN) and its nonlinearity increases the fractional spur and noise folding. Reducing the DTC range alleviates the stringent design tradeoffs among PN, linearity, and design complexity [3]. This work presents a 6GHz fractional-N sampling PLL with a DTC range-reduction technique. With the modified multi-modulus divider (MMD) and the DSM that controls it, the accumulated OE at the MMD output is halved for any given order of the DSM. The same technique can also be applied to a charge-pump PLL or a digital PLL to ease the design of the phase detector. This PLL achieves 80fsrms jitter and -72dBc fractional spur at l4.2mW power consumption. lt also supports a low-power mode with 91.5fsrms jitter and consumes 8.2mW, offering power and jitter tradeoff.",

Everything from streetlights to smart city cameras, automobiles, and appliances will be connected and generating continuous data. The unprecedented increase in the number of devices that generate data, most of which is unstructured, and the increase in the volume of data has led to a change in the way data is analysed, transported, and stored. This connectivity requires high aggregated bandwidth, low-latency as well as security. This has accelerated industry standards across many areas, including wireless, wireline, automotive, and data centers. This new era requires distributed computing that is also intelligent. More data needs to be processed where it is generated, while it is being transported and while it is at rest. At the same time, improvement in silicon technology has slowed down. Traditional computing platforms and architectures are unable to sufficiently scale to address the changing needs.",

      "abstract":"The rapid growth of hyperscale data centers has led to an increased demand for high-speed and low-latency data connectivity solution upgrades, which are power-efficient and minimal cost. In the last few years, PAM-4 modulation across copper channels was realized by high-performance electrical transceivers in a tight signal integrity environment, which employed the superior spectral efficiency of PAM-4 over NRZ signaling. This shift created a relatively smooth path from 28Gb/s NRZ to 56Gb/s PAM4 per lane by keeping the same baud rate, which eliminated the need to replace the legacy communication channel components with high-performance cables and connectors, providing a cost-effective solution to the overall system. To achieve 112Gb/s, solutions employed channel components which require a doubling of signal bandwidth, thus increasing system cost [1,2]. While such solutions commonly use two separate channels per lane, one for transmit (Tx) and one for receive (Rx), this paper demonstrates the utilization of simultaneous bidirectional Tx and Rx across each individual channel such that 112Gb/s can be achieved per lane while maintaining the 28Gbaud rate and thereby the legacy, low-cost copper channels (top of Fig. 11.8.1).",

      "abstract":"Recent advances in ADCs have enabled DSP-based equalization (e.g. extensive FFE and DFE) of wireline channels. FFE and canonical DFE sizes scale linearly with the number of taps, however the computational complexity of an FFE is much greater than that of a DFE. The canonical DFE is challenged by timing closure, and necessary techniques to ease it result in exponential growth in size. As a result, the majority of state-of-the-art DFE implementations have been limited to only 1-2 taps [1-4]. In this paper, a sliding-block DFE (SB-DFE) is introduced that enables pipelining and breaks the barrier to implementing much longer DFEs. Consequently, the DFE length can be extended to encompass all postcursors. Unlike FFEs, DFEs do not amplify noise. Moreover, a long DFE can relax or even remove the postcursor equalization burden on the CTLE and FFE, saving area and power.",

      "abstract":"The evolution of 3D depth-sensing technology enables various applications in mobile devices, from conventional photography enhancement (e.g., autofocus and bokeh effect) to new applications such as augmented reality and 3D scanning. Usually, 3D depth sensors operate with RGB color sensors for image fusion; the spatial resolution of depth sensors should be compatible to that of RGB sensors for better image fusion quality, which requires mega-pixel depth sensors. Among different depth-sensing techniques, only indirect time-of-flight (ToF) sensors can generate higher resolution depth maps with smaller system cost and power [1,2]. Recent indirect ToF sensors have achieved continuous improvements in depth performance [1-4]. However, one of the issues with indirect ToF sensors is peak current during exposure time [1,2]. To solve the issue, current spreading can be adopted by driving each column group in a different time point; the resulting column fixed-pattern phase noise (FPPN) is compensated by time-interleaving two opposite-directional delay chains [2]. However, this approach suffers from demodulation contrast (DC) degradation around the edge of the pixel array, by combining two different phase signals at the pixel level [2]. Another issue for indirect ToF sensors is multi-user interference [5]. When multiple ToF cameras with the same modulation frequency shine light onto the same object, the reflected light signals interfere each other, which may distort depth information. In this work, a mega-pixel indirect ToF sensor is reported with the solutions for the two issues: 1) peak current mitigation with minimal side-effect, and 2) multi-user interference cancellation.",

All four of the papers in this session have integrated CIM into their system setup, and comprehensively evaluate a variety of ML models in high bit precision. The first paper demonstrates a large CIM array with 4.5Mb with bit precision of 1-to-8b. The second paper reduces system energy by using zero skipping, a shared ADC using ping-pong CIM, and digital-predictor-assisted adaptive bit-precision to save power in the ADC. The third paper reduces memory-device footprint by replacing 6T SRAM with 3T plus capacitor. The final paper in the session applies the tensor-train method to decompose and compress neural networks so that they fit within on-chip memory.",

Electrical stimulation of peripheral nerves has been shown effective in treating major intractable disorders ranging from autoimmune disorder to chronic pain. It acts on specific nerves and avoids significant side effects of most drugs. Closed-loop PNS neurostimulators offer the additional benefits of personalization and optimality of the treatment. Such medical devices infer physiological function from measurable nerve action potentials and deliver custom-tailored electrical stimulation to elicit desired clinical outcomes.",

      "abstract":"The rapid surge of data transmission within computation, storage and communication infrastructures is pushing the speed boundary of traditional copper-based electrical links. Recent realizations of 100Gb/s wired links require advanced FinFET technologies, highcost packaging/cables and power-consuming equalization. High-frequency waves over dielectric waveguides have been considered as an alternative solution that exploits the low-loss, broadband medium while maintaining compatibility with existing silicon IC platforms. However, since its debut in 2011 [1], this scheme, previously using ≤140GHz carriers, has only achieved data rates of up to 36Gb/s [2]. It is expected that higher carrier frequencies (e.g. >200GHz) and multi-channel aggregation would further increase the data rate while shrinking the interconnect size; but that scheme has been hindered by challenges related to the required high-order multiplexer and ultra-broadband waveguide coupler operating efficiently at sub terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies. In this paper, using a 130nm SiGe BiCMOS technology, we present a multi-channel, multiplexer/coupler-integrated transmitter (Tx) that delivers a data rate of 105Gb/s (3×35Gb/s). To demodulate each channel, a 35Gb/s coupler-integrated receiver (Rx) is also developed. Our link, including the chipset and a 0.4mm-wide, 30cm-long dielectric ribbon, experimentally demonstrates the potential speed, efficiency, size and cost advantages of THz fiber links in high-speed inter-server and backplane fabrics.",

To maximize the channel capacity, throughput, and frequency diversity, mm-wave wireless standards often mandate channels with GHz bandwidth (BW) over multiple non-contiguous bands. Also, as spectrally efficient highpeak-to-average power-ratio (PAPR) modulations such as OFDMs are widely employed, system dynamic range and linearity have become critical. Moreover, to compensate for the mm-wave path loss and enable diverse MIMO operations, there is an increasing need for complex high-density arrays with high system energy efficiency. These requirements have posed tremendous technical challenges on mm-wave front-ends, in particular PAs.",

      "abstract":"Wireless power transfer (WPT) systems are becoming increasingly popular for sub100mW biomedical applications [1] -[5]. Because the received power is sensitive to coupling and loading conditions, power/voltage regulations are essential to achieve stable and accurate power delivery, fast transient response, and high end-to-end (E2E) efficiency, which includes all the power losses in the transmitter (TX), wireless power link, and the receiver (RX). Many existing WPT designs operated in open-loop [3] -[5]; or achieved voltage regulation but only in the RX [6], with the TX remained unregulated and designed to operate at full capacity, thus degraded E2E efficiency at light-load conditions. Because lower-power or standby mode typically contributes to the majority of the operation time, light-load efficiency is always an important specification of power management circuits, especially to extend the run time for battery-powered devices, e.g., a wearable/portable WPT transmitter supporting bioimplants. [1], [2], [7] -[9] have reported different approaches to achieve TX regulation; however, all required extra discrete components, which increased the form-factor and cost. [7], [8] required a wire to close the loop. [1], [2], [9] utilized load-shift-keying (LSK) backscattering for TX regulation, which was proved an effective solution. However, [2], [9] relied on lots of off-chip components, including power inductors, diodes, DACs, FPGAs, etc., due to the analog control methodologies. The linear control also introduced small-signal bandwidth limitations, which required careful design to ensure stability at different loading/coupling conditions with PVT/component variations, and resulted in significant compromise in dynamic performance. [1] introduced a nonlinear constant-idle-time control to eliminate the bandwidth limitations and most of the off-chip components; however, the light-load efficiency still suffered. In addition, [1] still required an extra sensing coil to extract LSK signals that increased the TX coil area by 86%.",

      "abstract":"Inductive DC-DC converters are fundamentally limited by the trade-off between conduction losses and switching losses. Miniaturized converters used in applications such as mobile devices suffer badly from this trade off, as a small inductor has a large DCR, which contributes large I2 RDCR conduction losses, while a small inductance desires high frequency operation, which implies high CGATE V2 f hard charging switching losses from the power MOSFET gate drivers. Interestingly, the rise/fall time of such drivers cannot be too rapid, regardless of switching frequency, due to inductive ringing causing potential voltage stresses [1], [2]. To ease the conduction/switching loss trade-off, it is possible to exploit the requirement for finite rise/fall time by replacing conventionally hard-switching gate drivers with adiabatic charge-recycling (CR) gate drivers. As depicted in Fig. 17.5.1 (top right), CR can, through the help of inductor LR, recycle the charge stored on CGATE to another capacitance, CSTORE (and vice-versa), theoretically with 100% efficiency. This approach was demonstrated in [3], where the charge on the power MOSFET gates are recycled to two auxiliary capacitors through two separate inductors (Fig. 17.5.1, top left). However, besides the overhead of two inductors, recycling with separate storage capacitors introduces indirect losses, while the separated duty-cycled resonate gate drivers makes non-overlap timing control between power MOSFETs difficult. By AC-coupling the power NMOS to the resonant gate driver as in [4] (Fig. 17.5.1, bottom left), it is possible to reduce the number of resonant inductors to 1. However, the non-overlap time cannot be precisely controlled, leading to potentially large overlap losses, and the limited duty-cycle control through driver slope modulation prevents robust regulation across a wide output range.",

      "abstract":"Low-power internet-of-things (IoT) devices sometimes use two independent crystal oscillators (XOs): a 32.768kHz XO for the real-time clock (RTC) and a tens of MHz XO for low-jitter clock and carrier synthesis. To reduce the number of XOs, 32kHz-reference phase-locked loops (PLLs) [1], [2] have been reported. However, the jitter performance is degraded due to narrow loop bandwidth, e.g., less than 3kHz, limited by the 32kHz reference frequency. To break this limitation, a 2.4GHz fractional-N oversampling PLL (OSPLL) with a 32kHz reference is proposed in this paper. The proposed DAC-and DTC-assisted OSPLL realizes a 200kHz loop bandwidth and 5.79ps rms jitter with 4.97mW power consumption in a 65nm CMOS technology.",

      "abstract":"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has proliferated rapidly and widely into application areas such as speech recognition, health care, and autonomous driving. To increase the capabilities of AI more powerful systems are needed to process a larger amount of data. This requirement has made domain-specific accelerators, such as GPUs and TPUs, popular; as they can provide orders of magnitude higher performance than state-of-the-art CPUs. However, these accelerators can only operate at their peak performance when they get the necessary data from memory as quickly as it is processed: requiring off-chip memory with a high bandwidth and a large capacity [1]. HBM has thus far met the bandwidth and capacity requirement [2-6], but recent AI technologies such as recurrent neural networks require an even higher bandwidth than HBM [7-8]. While a further increase in off-chip bandwidth can be accomplished by various techniques, it is often limited by power constraints at the chip or system level [9]. Hence, it is essential to decrease demand for off-chip bandwidth with unconventional architectures: such as processing-in-memory. In this paper, we present function-Inmemory DRAM (FIMDRAM) that integrates a 16-wide single-instruction multiple-data engine within the memory banks and that exploits bank-level parallelism to provide 4× higher processing bandwidth than an off-chip memory solution. Second, we show techniques that do not require any modification to conventional memory controllers and their command protocols, which make FIMDRAM more practical for quick industry adoption. Finally, we conclude this paper with circuitand system-level evaluations of our fabricated FIMDRAM.",

      "abstract":"IoT sensors are in rising demand and they often require low power, yet high precision measurements. Under constrained energy, Nyquist-rate SAR ADCs are typically used for readout as they are energy efficient and easy to multiplex across many sensors. However, achieving high precision (>14b) in SAR ADCs is challenging as all factors limiting performance (resolution, mismatch, and noise) must be simultaneously addressed with minimal energy impact. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient, capacitor-array-assisted cascaded charge-injection SAR ADC (c-ciSAR) with 17b nominal resolution (14.14b ENOB) that achieves a 184.9dB Schreier FoM (SFoM) and 4.32fJ/conv with a 1V supply in 0.18μm CMOS. The ADC deploys a combination of techniques to improve resolution, mismatch, and noise performance while remaining energy-efficient, namely: 1) hybridization of a capacitor-array DAC (CDAC) with charge-injection-cell (ci-cell) based DACs (ciDACs) to achieve high resolution and flexible programmability; 2) direct analog DAC mismatch compensation and repeated LSB decisions that leverage flexible programmability; 3) a noise-efficient charge-domain preamplifier for comparator (1.66 NEF) and SNR extended ci-cell; and 4) ±2·VDD signal sampling with pre-sampling MSB decision.",

      "abstract":"Summary form only given, as follows. The complete presentation was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings. High performance phase-locked loops are critical enabling elements for an extraordinary range of applications. Wireless applications demand low noise, frequency agility, and support for advanced power management. Wireline applications demand exceptional noise performance at very high operating frequencies. Data converters also demand very high performance clocks to achieve performance targets. Processors and SoCs demand flexible, highly responsive clock subsystems. And once the clock is generated, the challenge of distributing it to target sub-blocks without losing the performance the PLL designer worked so hard to achieve remains. This short course will therefore cover topics in frequency synthesis as well as clock distribution and management. The first presentation will describe the fundamentals of PLL architecture and modeling and key design considerations for wireless applications. The second presentation will present a range of architectural choices, including digital and hybrid PLL fundamentals, along with design examples focused on key application considerations. The third presentation will describe approaches for implementing clock subsystems in wired and wireless communication examples. Finally, the fourth presentation will explore clock distribution and management techniques for large-scale processor or ASIC designs. ",

      "abstract":"Several factors drive the demand for DRAM bandwidth scaling: in addition to established applications in visualization, there has been a proliferation of data-intensive applications enabled by advancements in AI, ML and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) [1]. While high-bandwidth memory (HBM) provides an alternative solution, its high cost makes it impractical for many applications. On the other hand, extending the GDDR roadmap beyond GDDR6 through per-pin bandwidth scaling presents significant obstacles: including the reduced link-timing budget and the slow DRAM transistors. This paper introduces an 8Gb DRAM with a single-ended PAM4 interface to redirect and extend the GDDR roadmap. The design supports 22Gb/s/pin, a 22% increase over the highest published GDDR6 DRAM bandwidth [2], in a conventional 1Ynm DRAM process.",

      "abstract":"As memory-centric workloads (AI, graph-analytics) continue to gain momentum, technology solutions that provide higher on-die memory capacity/bandwidth can provide scalability beyond SRAM. Resistive RAM (RRAM) owing to (1) higher bit-density (2-4× of SRAM), (2) CMOS process/voltage compatibility, (3) nano-second read (RD) and (4) non-volatility has emerged as a promising candidate [1]. In spite of early prototypes, several technology challenges remain, and need to be addressed through circuit-technology co-design [1]. This paper presents a 64Kb RRAM macro supporting: (1) a programmable (1 to 9) number of row-accesses (N) to enable vector-matrix multiplication (referred to as compute-in-memory, or CIM) for a target algorithm-level inference-accuracy [2] -[8], (2) voltage-based RD with active feedback, advancing the state-of-the-art current-based RD, targeted for the low ratio between the high-resistance-state (HRS) and low-resistance-state (LRS) in typical RRAM, (3) RD-disturb tolerance under RRAM drift, through embedded RD-disturb monitor and write (WR)-back and (4) in-situ WR verification to enable a tight resistance distribution.",

      "abstract":"Quantum computers (QCs) promise significant speedup for relevant computational problems that are intractable by classical computers. QCs process information stored in quantum bits (qubits) that must be typically cooled down to cryogenic temperatures. Since state-of-the-art QCs employ only a few qubits, those qubits can be driven and read out by room-temperature electronics connected to the cryogenic qubits by only a few wires. However, practical QCs will require more than thousands of qubits, making this approach impractical due to system complexity and reliability concerns. Although frequency multiplexing would reduce the interconnects to room temperature by fitting many qubit channels in the same physical interconnect, an excessive number of interconnects would still be required. An alternative, more scalable solution is a cryogenic electronic interface operating very close to the quantum processor to keep the whole control loop at cryogenic temperature, hence avoiding any high-speed interconnect to room temperature. This system must comprise drivers, readout circuits (LNAs, ADCs), and a digital controller to steer the quantum-algorithm execution [1]. While cryogenic CMOS (cryo-CMOS) wideband drivers and LNAs supporting qubit frequency multiplexing have been shown before [1] -[3], no wideband cryo-CMOS ADC has been demonstrated yet.",

      "abstract":"On-device machine learning is critical for mobile products as it enables real-time applications (e.g. AI-powered camera applications), which need to be responsive, always available (i.e. do not require network connectivity) and privacy preserving. The platforms used in such situations have limited computing resources, power, and memory bandwidth. Enabling such on-device machine learning has triggered wide development of efficient neural-network accelerators that promise high energy and area efficiency compared to general-purpose processors, such as CPUs. The need to support a comprehensive range of neural networks has been important as well because the field of deep learning is evolving rapidly as depicted in Fig. 9.5.1. Recent work on neural-network accelerators has focused on improving energy efficiency, while obtaining high performance in order to meet the needs of real-time applications. For example, weightzero-skipping and pruning have been deployed in recent accelerators [2] -[7]. SIMD or systolic array-based accelerators [2] -[4], [6] provide flexibility to support various types of compute across a wide range of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models.",

      "abstract":"Driven by the proliferation of rich media services and a drastic increase of data availability, the demand for high-speed data transfer in the data center continues to grow at greater than 26 percent year-over-year [1]. This urges the imminent solution of top-of-rack switches in hyperscale networks with faster I/O interfaces to simultaneously support both low power and high throughput. Supporting the substantial bandwidth increase has driven the development of new electrical and optical interconnect standards which enable 100Gb/s per channel including IEEE 802.3ck and CEI-112G with PAM-4 modulation in conjunction with forward error correction (FEC) [2]. For long-reach applications, a transceiver architecture with >40dB channel equalization is critical due to the extra 8-10dB package insertion loss. To resolve those bottlenecks, this work presents an ADC-DSP based PAM-4 transceiver capable of equalizing >41.5dB lossy channels and achieving 112Gb/s per channel and 896Gb/s overall retimer throughput in 7nm FinFET.",

Security primitives require increasing levels of protection against physical manipulation and passive side-channel attacks. The first paper describes a unified inmemory TRNG/PUF, followed by techniques for power and EM side-channel attack resistance. A strong PUF based on an SPN network and hot-carrier injection is presented. The next two papers cover additional PUFs, which are respectively based on oscillator collapse and a self-checking and self-healing technique.",

      "abstract":"Capacitive sensors are widely deployed in low-power IoT nodes, where power consumption is stringently limited by the batteries or energy harvesters. Energy-efficient interface circuits that convert sensing information into digital code are important for successful application of such sensors. Two humidity sensors based on a frequencylocking loop (FLL) [1] and a delta-sigma modulator (DSM) [2] achieve high resolution, but at the expense of high power consumption of 10.32μW and 15.6μW, respectively. The Zoom-based humidity sensor in [3] and capacitor-to-digital converters (CDC) in [3,4] exhibit a significantly improved dynamic range (DR). However, the DSM in the Zoom scheme typically entails large redundancy to cover the SAR conversion error due to noise or interference. Further, the OTA current budget is set to drive the maximum input capacitance, thus wasting power when driving typically small capacitance in most cases.",

      "abstract":"The unprecedented growth in deep neural networks (DNN) size has led to massive amounts of data movement from off-chip memory to on-chip processing cores in modern machine learning (ML) accelerators. Compute-in-memory (CIM) designs performing analog DNN computations within a memory array, along with peripheral mixed-signal circuits, are being explored to mitigate this memory-wall bottleneck: consisting of memory latency and energy overhead. Embedded-dynamic random-access memory (eDRAM) [1], [2], which integrates the 1T1C (T=Transistor, C=Capacitor) DRAM bitcell monolithically along with high-performance logic transistors and interconnects, can enable custom CIM designs. It offers the densest embedded bitcell, a low pJ/bit access energy, a low soft error rate, high-endurance, high-performance, and high-bandwidth: all desired attributes for ML accelerators. In addition, the intrinsic charge sharing operation during a dynamic memory access can be used effectively to perform analog CIM computations: by reconfiguring existing eDRAM columns as charge domain circuits, thus, greatly minimizing peripheral circuit area and power overhead. Configuring a part of eDRAM as a CIM engine (for data conversion, DNN computations, and weight storage) and retaining the remaining part as a regular memory (for inputs, gradients during training, and non-CIM workload data) can help to meet the layer/kernel dependent variable storage needs during a DNN inference/training step. Thus, the high cost/bit of eDRAM can be amortized by repurposing part of existing large capacity, level-4 eDRAM caches [7] in high-end microprocessors, into large-scale CIM engines.",

      "abstract":"Millimeter-wave (mm-wave) radar is an essential sensor of advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. Its detection requirement extends from traditional long-to-medium range to emerging short and ultra-short range for surround sensing, which is from sub-1 meter to 40 meters and requires a compact and low-cost solution with fast chirp generation to improve the range resolution [1] -[5]. In [2], 3 transmitters (TX) and 4 receivers (RX) are utilized to create a multi-mode radar transceiver, however its on-board antenna integration solution limits its size and cost for short-distance applications. In [3], 12TX and 16RX phase-domain multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar is presented. However an external PLL is required, and the digitalprocessing power consumption is high. Furthermore its size and cost are not suitable for short and ultra-short applications. In [4], a compact 1TX and 1RX frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radar is applied with an antenna-in-package (AiP) for short-distance applications, however its detection range is limited to only 20meters. This work presents a compact 76-to-81GHz FMCW MIMO radar with fast chirp generation and integrated with an AiP array in embedded glass fan-out (eGFO) technology for short and ultra-short range application. A fast-modulated chirp signal is especially crucial in MIMO radar for improving range resolution with update rate, and it also moves IF frequency away from the 1/f noise corner. Thanks to the dynamic bias technique, the chirp rate is improved to 312.5MHz/μs and the maximum modulation bandwidth is 7.2GHz. In addition, the 2TX and 6RX array antennas are integrated in package, and effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of the TX antenna is improved by 7.5dB by a coaxial feeding structure in eGFO technology with multi-feed antenna technique.",

      "abstract":"The applications of large-area electronics (LAEs) based on thin-film transistors (TFTs) are rapidly expanding from displays to sensors. For the TFT gate drivers, high-voltage bipolar supply rails (approximately ±15V) are required; so far, they have been typically generated from a battery (VBAT) by employing switched-capacitor converters (SCCs) [1]. Since a high SNR is crucial for TFT-based sensors such as an under-display fingerprint sensor [2], the noise and ripple of the SCC output, which are prone to be coupled to the readout AFE, should be minimized. As a straightforward method, an LDO can be utilized as a post-regulator in series with the SCC. However, the relatively large dropout voltage (VDO) of the LDO significantly degrades the efficiency [3]. In contrast, small VDO reduces LDO loop-gain due to the pass-transistor working in the triode region, resulting in decreased supply-ripple rejection (PSR). From the perspective of SCC, owing to its fixed voltage conversion ratio (VCR), the VDO cannot be finely regulated over a wide variation of VBAT. For fine regulation, the complexity (cost) overhead or the power loss will increase in the SC circuit. In this work, an energy-recycled optimal VDO control (EROC) technique in the SC bipolar step-up stage is proposed for higher efficiency. Also, load-current-reused (LCR) post-regulator is presented to achieve high PSR while extremely minimizing the power loss at the pass-transistor.",

The next paper presents a 28GHz reflection-coefficient sensor for mm-wave antenna-tuner applications.

      "abstract":"Wireless technologies have propelled major advances in various industries including telecommunications, entertainment, and smart environments. Today, radios are embedded in cellphones, wearable devices, sensors, and control systems. Yet, in all of these diverse domains, radios are used for communications. Even when embedded in a sensor, the radio signals are used for communicating the sensed data, rather than performing the sensing function. We argue that future innovations should leverage radio signals for sensing. Radio signals are fascinating creatures: they travel in space, traverse walls and occlusions, and reflect off people and objects. The reflected signals are modulated by people's movements, actions, respiration, and heart beats. By analyzing such radio reflections, we can learn much information about people and their physiological signals, and leverage such knowledge to enable new capabilities and novel applications.",

We present Vega, an always-on IoT end-node SoC capable of scaling from a 1.7 μW fully retentive COGNITIVE sleep mode up to 32.2GOPS (@49.4mW) peak performance on NSAAs, including mobile DNN inference, exploiting 1.6MB of state- retentive SRAM, and 4MB of non-volatile MRAM. To meet the performance and flexibility requirements of NSAAs, the SoC features 10 RISC-V cores: one core for SoC and IO management and a 9-core cluster supporting multi-precision SIMD integer and floating- point computation. Two programmable machine-learning (ML) accelerators boost energy efficiency in sleep and active state, respectively.",

For example, hyperthermia cancer therapy, which raises the local temperature of tumors up to 43-45°C, can trigger apoptosis and disrupt cancer cells' ability to repair DNA damage [1]. In neuroscience, temperature-sensitive ion channels can be thermally activated using MNP-induced heating, which allows for minimally invasive brain stimulation [2,3]. Compared to dielectric heating and ohmic heating, MNP-based magnetic heating offers superior specificity and minimal damage to the surrounding tissues since most biological systems are non-magnetic.",

      "abstract":"It is projected that 75 billion Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices will be deployed for applications such as wearable electronics and smart home by 2025. Securing IoT devices is one of the most significant barriers we need to overcome for large-scale IoT adoption. Conventional wireless security has been implemented solely using upper-layer cryptography [1]. Unfortunately, IoT nodes are often energy-constrained and may not have enough computational resources to implement advanced asymmetric cryptographic algorithms and public-key-infrastructures (PKI) [2]-[3]. To overcome this challenge, there has been growing interest in leveraging the physical impairments of the radios that are bonded to specific TX for secure identification [4] -[6], a.k.a. RF fingerprinting. If Bob (the RX) has sufficient sensitivity, it can identify Alice (the legitimate TX) and the malicious impersonator during demodulation based on their inherent radio signatures, similar to how we distinguish different people based on their unique voice signatures (Fig. 12.3.1). As the device-dependent radio impairments come from process variation, it is challenging for impersonators to forge in practice. In addition, unlike conventional identification approach that device IDs are inserted in preambles and checked only once a while, RF fingerprinting enables continuous identification at any moment during communication, leading to a tighter bond between the data packet and device.",

      "abstract":"Strong physically unclonable functions (Strong PUFs) are expected to meet the low-energy and low-latency authentication requirements of IoT applications, owing to their exponential number of challenge-response pairs (CRPs). However, Strong PUFs suffer from vulnerability to modeling attacks and a high bit-error rate (BER). The first Strong PUF, known as the arbiter PUF, has little tolerance against modeling attacks because of the linear summation of path-delay times in its response [1]. Several studies have been conducted to improve immunity by introducing non-linearity in the response-generation procedure [2] -[6]. Out of these, only look-up-table (LUT)-based solutions [2], [6] achieved a high machine-learning (ML) robustness against more than 0.1M training CRPs. However, the design in [2] requires 112K bits of entropy, and that in [6] uses many AES S-boxes, as well as entropy sources. The complex response procedures cause high native BER in Strong PUFs, although zero error is not essential because cryptography is not needed in the authentication procedure. CRP filtering [3], [5], [6], a popular countermeasure, not only reduces usable CRPs, but it also requires the server to perform additional tasks in both enrollment and authentication. Taking advantage of a LUT, one can apply SRAM-PUF stabilization techniques. Hot-carrier-injection (HCI) burn-in [7] does not reduce the number of usable bitcells. However, conventionally, it requires the inverse data to be written back before HCI burn-in. Although this could be done on-chip, it provides a potential attack point to an adversary.",

      "abstract":"Millimeter-wave (mm-wave) imaging radars and communication systems operating at W-band obtain an ever-increasing attention due to their high-resolution and high data rate [1] -[6]. However, because of the challenges of lower active device gain and greater passive loss, most W-Band transceivers (TRXs) do not integrate T/R switches and attenuators [1] -[6], which will significantly reduce the system performance and increase the cost. In this paper, we propose a W-band bidirectional phased-array TRX FE in a 65nm CMOS technology to support communication and radar applications in which three critical issues of higher mm-wave-band phased-array TRX FE have been initially dealt with: 1) the large insertion loss (IL) of the T/R switch, 2) the limited resolution and 3) gain/phase variation of the phase shifter (PS) and attenuator. The concept of EM coupling was applied in the W-band circuit design and the couple-based T/R switches, PSs and attenuators were integrated in the TRX FE, achieving <; 1dB T/R switch IL, > 12.3% peak PAE at 15.1dBm output power and <; 1°/dB phase/gain resolution with <; ±2.1dB/±6° gain/phase variation.",

      "abstract":"High-density embedded nonvolatile memory (eNVM) at advanced technology nodes is still in great demand for SOC chips used in consumer electronics, self-driving cars, industrial control, and IoT edge devices. Although embedded NOR Flash is still main stream, its process complexity and high integration cost make it difficult to scale beyond 28nm. RRAM has become a promising alternative owing to its excellent scalability, low power, and compatibility with logic processes [1 -6]. However, several challenges still exist that restrict RRAM from practical eNVM applications, as shown in Fig. 24.2.1. 1) a high supply voltage is needed, because of high operation voltages and a considerable voltage drop on write path. 2) The IR drop on write path varies significantly with the distance of a cell from the peripheral circuits. 3) Prior self-write termination (SWT), with its abrupt cutoff, fails to form dense conductive filaments (CFs). While delayed termination helps to alleviate this issue, its delay time is not optimized for fast and slow cells [3]. 4) Previous read reference schemes that use a small number of HRS/LRS cells may collapse when encountering tail bits, resulting in a poor reference [6]. In this work, we demonstrate a 1Mb 14nm-FinFET RRAM with a 0.022 μm2 cell size. The cell array is in a deep N-well with adequate P-substrate biasing to alleviate the difficulty of high voltage transfer. Placing the bit line (BL) and source line (SL) drivers on the top and bottom of the array reduces the IR-drop variation for near and far cells. Self-adaptive delayed termination (SADT) adjusts the termination time according to cell characteristics (fast or slow), helping to generate robust CFs. A read reference with multiple dummy 1T1R cells avoids the reference collapse issue. The test chip supports reliable read operation at a minimum supply voltage of 0.5V from -40°C to 125°C.",

MEMS thermal flow sensors currently achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of resolution, size, and power consumption [1, 3]. However, they only measure volumetric flow, and so must be calibrated for use with specific liquids [1] or gases [2, 3]. In contrast, Coriolis flow sensors measure mass flow and thus do not need calibration for specific fluids. Furthermore, their resonance frequency can be used as a measure of fluid density. These features enable significant size, cost, and complexity reductions in low-flow microfluidic systems. Although much progress has been made, miniature [4] and MEMS [5- 7] Coriolis mass flow sensors are still outperformed by their thermal counterparts, especially in terms of resolution and long-term stability.",

      "abstract":"Full-duplex (FD) transceivers remain a significant challenge as they require >100dB of cancellation of high levels of self-interference (SI), recreation of large SI channel delay spreads, and real-time canceler adaptation. SI cancelers based on frequency-domain equalization (FDE) [1,2] demand multiple widely-tunable power-hungry high-Q filters, while those based on FIR-based time-domain equalization (TDE) [3-5] require large delays with fine resolution (see Fig. 6.6.1 for a system simulation based on the isolation profile of an SI channel, where the TX-RX leakage spreads across several 10s of nanoseconds). Additionally, supporting realistic antenna interface isolations of ~20dB requires a low-loss canceler and stresses canceler noise and linearity [6]. This work introduces - (i) an N-path switched-capacitor (SC) delay-line with stacked-capacitor voltage gain while enabling nearly ten nanoseconds of RF true-time delay across a large BW (DC to 1GHz), (ii) a new LNTA canceler where the FIR weighting, summation, and output buffer of the canceler is absorbed into the LNTA, and (iii) a closed-loop adaptation algorithm leveraging analytical modeling of tap non-idealities that reduces the computational complexity and data storage. Leveraging a 16-tap RF canceler operating across DC to 1GHz with delays ranging from 0.25ps to 8ns (8× compared to [5] and 40× compared to [4]) and a complex-weighted 8-tap BB canceler with delays ranging from 10ns to 85ns, the FD receiver achieves (i) tunable operation across 200MHz to 1GHz, (ii) wideband SI suppression of up to 65dB (54dB) across 40MHz (80MHz), when operating at 800MHz (13dB higher than [5] while achieving 2× cancellation BW), with (iii) modest NF degradation of 0.8dB (2.8dB) for the low-power mode (high-power mode), while (iv) handling TX power of up to +15dBm (6dB higher than [5]) across an initial circulator isolation of only 23dB (11 to 18dB better than [1-4]).",

      "abstract":"Frequency synthesizers are critical for millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) radars. Large-chirp-bandwidth (BWchirp) sawtooth waveforms are required to be synthesized with fast slope and high-frequency linearity for accurate detection of targets or high-quality imaging. Fractional-N phase-locked loops (PLLs) with a two-point-modulation (TPM) scheme are widely used to synthesize fast highlinearity chirps [1-3]. However, for a wideband multi-bank digitally controlled oscillator (DCO), the intrinsic 1/√LC nonlinearity and the frequency discontinuity from overlaps between adjacent tuning bands introduce a significant gain mismatch between the two modulation paths of the TPM scheme and degrade the chirp linearity [3,5]. To linearize the DCO tuning curve, a piecewise linear pre-distortion method is commonly used as shown in Fig. 32.5.1 [3]. In this method, the overlaps are mitigated by scaling every band with the same factor SC, which is based on the assumption that ratios of each DCO tuning band to the corresponding coarse frequency step remain the same. In practice, precise matching between these bands cannot be guaranteed. Each tuning band is then linearly fitted with its average gain gi, but non-ideal residual frequency errors may still deteriorate the chirp linearity. As a DCO bandwidth increases, the mismatches and residual frequency errors tend to be more severe, making this method unsuitable for wideband FMCW synthesizers.",

      "abstract":"Motion and stimulation artifacts encountered in wearable sensors present difficult dynamic range (DR) and linearity challenges: AFEs need to be able to resolve μV-level signals in the presence of artifacts up to 100s of mV in amplitude while maintaining linearity without saturation, such that the signal of interest can be readily recovered during post-processing. Since it is not possible to build an amplifier with appreciable gain and linearity for >100mV inputs under <; 1V SoC-compatible supply, most high-DR AFEs instead incorporate an LNA into a ΔΣ-based ADC-direct architecture [1-3]. However, as many emerging wearable devices desire single-chip integration in scaled CMOS for size and digital performance considerations, conventional ΔΣMs, which rely on voltage-domain building blocks, suffer from reduced intrinsic gain and headroom. Instead, time-domain quantization through VCO-based AFEs benefits from scaled CMOS and offers intrinsic 1st-order noise shaping. However, the non-linear V-F conversion of conventional VCO-based AFEs makes achieving a large and linear DR difficult [1]. To address this, [3] adopts a differential pulse code modulation (DPCM) technique that enables the VCO to process only a small prediction error, VERR, by subtracting from VIN a digital predictor value fed through a DAC (Fig. 28.1.1 top). Maximal linearity would be achieved if the predictor was perfect, resulting in VERR ≈ 0; however, this requires a high-performance and power-expensive DAC. Therefore, [3] truncates the predictor's output, reducing the DAC requirements to 9b, but adding truncation error, ET. If the gain of paths P1 and P2 are made equal, which is enforced in [3] via a gain error calibration (GEC) circuit, ET will ideally cancel at the output. However, it is not possible to achieve perfect ET cancellation, and any residual ET will degrade SQNR, limiting the extent to which truncation can be used to relax the DAC's resolution. In addition, GEC itself introduces power overhead.",

      "abstract":"This session highlights advances in state-of-the-art analog interfaces. The first paper describes a power-aware high-performance humidity sensor, followed by an ultra-low-voltage capacitance-to-digital converter without external references. Next, two temperature sensors are presented, one with the most compact size ever reported for hot-spots monitoring, and the other with a high self-calibrated accuracy of up to 0.03°C using a hybrid sensor core. The following two papers report highly-efficient magnetometers for contactless current sensing. The session continues with a high-resolution MEMS Coriolis mass-flow sensor readout. The last paper introduces a high-slew single-stage amplifier for large capacitive loads, showcasing the best figures-of-merit over the state of the art.",

      "abstract":"Wireless communication at ~300 GHz is drawing attention due to its potential to support a high data-rate using the wide available bandwidth. Transmitters operating at ~300 GHz have been reported in [1] -[5]. In order to support the high-order modulation, high datarate, and an increased range, the transmitter must have a high output 1dB compression point (OP1dB) and a wide bandwidth. Unfortunately, instead of OP1dB, only the saturated output power levels, Psat, of the CMOS transmitters [3- 5] are reported. A 272GHz CMOS amplifier has been reported in [6], but it only achieves an OP1dB of -10.18dBm and a 3dB bandwidth of less than 5GHz. Broadband power amplification at 300GHz in CMOS is not practical since the transistor fmax is ~350 GHz or less. Due to this, the CMOStransmitter linear output power is limited by the upconversion mixer OP1dB. Unfortunately, the mixers operating near 300GHz suffer from low conversion gain (CG) and OP1dB.",

      "abstract":"With continuous exploitation of sub-6GHz wireless communication standards and the advent of 5G and 6G, the demand for faster speed and wider coverage keeps evolving. While it is expected to utilize higher working frequency to provide larger bandwidth, lower noise figure (NF) is also preferred to achieve better sensitivity or wider coverage. A straightforward solution to achieve a low NF is to employ LNA-first architecture; this configuration helps to achieve a sub-2dB NF for frequencies up to 6GHz. However, the Gm-cell does consume extra power [1,2]. Meanwhile, noise cancellation techniques are widely used to improve the noise performance [3-5]. Nevertheless, due to the input parasitic capacitance, the common-source/mixer-first hybrid architecture cannot guarantee a low NF for frequencies above 3GHz [3]. The 1.8dB-NF 5GHz receiver eliminates the noise contribution of its input series inductor but requires a large power consumption (~100mW) [4]. Similar power consumption is needed for the frequencytranslational quadrature-hybrid receiver [5].",

      "abstract":"Power delivering with galvanic isolation is essential to guarantee system safety and reliability in harsh industry environments. However, efficiently transferring power of hundreds of mW across an isolation barrier is challenging for such sizeand costconstrained applications. Isolated capacitive power transfer using on-chip capacitors and an off-chip inductor is demonstrated in [1], but it only delivers 62mW power with <; 1kV isolation voltage that is limited by the on-chip capacitors. To increase the output power and the isolation voltage, isolated DC-DC converters using silicon-based postprocessed micro-transformers have been reported recently [2-4]. In [2], 6-μm-thick plated Au are used for both the primary and the secondary coil windings to achieve quality factors of 6.8 at 200MHz, while the efficiency of the converter is lower than 34% with a maximum output power of 0.8W. A performance-enhanced micro-transformer using a magnetic core is proposed in [3] to achieve a peak efficiency of 52% and a maximum output power of 1.1W. However, the fabrication process of such a transformer is complex and the cost is high. In [4], the micro-transformer is formed by using ultrathick metal windings, and high inductances with high quality factors are achieved to allow the converter to switch at 11MHz. However, the topology proposed produces large resonant currents that flow into the coils, degrading the efficiency to 34% with only 165mW output power. Moreover, the abovementioned isolated converters are assembled in a small-outline integrated-circuit (SOIC) 8-lead [2] or 28-lead [3] packages that measure 6mm×10mm or 10mm×18mm, respectively, resulting in a maximum power density of only 13.33mW/mm2.",

      "abstract":"As the utilization of the mm-wave spectrum becomes active, designers' interests are shifting to even higher frequencies in the W-band. Given their potential use as carrier frequencies for the next-generation mobiles (i.e., beyond 5G), these W-band signals must have ultra-low phase noise (PN). Currently, the most popular solution to generate such frequencies is with a cascaded architecture: a first-stage PLL generates a low-PN signal at a relatively low frequency at which the VCO LC tank has a high Q factor, and following frequency multipliers (FMs) increase the frequency to the W-band [1]. Although various FMs have been proposed, all of them are limited in their ability to achieve a high multiplication factor, M. Push-push or harmonic-selection circuits have high conversion losses. Injection-locked FMs (ILFMs) require multiple stages due to their narrow lock ranges, which increase power consumption and complexity. Thus, single-stage direct PLLs [2-4] would be preferred if they could have a sufficiently wide loop bandwidth to suppress the poor PN of a W-band VCO. Subsampling PLLs (SSPLLs) are suitable for extending the bandwidth since they have low in-band PN due to the high phase-error (φERR) detection gain of a subsampling phase detector (PD). Nevertheless, when SSPLLs operate in the W-band, the degradation of PN is unavoidable because the φERR detection gain decreases as the frequency of the VCO, fVCO, increases. As described at the left of Fig. 23.4.1, when the switch of the PD, SWPD, is closed, the output of the PD, SPD, should track the signal of the VCO, SVCO, closely. However, when fVCO increases to the W-band, the amplitude of SPD is reduced significantly by a parasitic pole that is present due to the turned-on resistance of SWPD, RON, and the sampling capacitor, CS. When SWPD is turned off, φERR is detected in SPD, but its magnitude is already suppressed significantly relative to that in SVCO. This effect also can be interpreted in the frequency domain where SVCO is suppressed by a low-pass filter before the information of φERR is extracted at the baseband frequencies.",

      "abstract":"Computing-in-memory (CIM) is an attractive approach for energy-efficient neural network (NN) processors, especially for low-power edge devices. Previous CIM chips have demonstrated macro and system-level design enabling multi-bit operations and sparsity support. However, several challenges exist, as shown in Fig. 15.2.1. First, though a previously proposed block-wise sparsity strategy can power off ADCs, zeros still contributed to storage requirements, and power gating was not applied to computing resources. Second, on-chip SRAM CIM macros are not large enough to hold all weights. Updating weights between computing operations leads to significant performance loss. Finally, the limited sensing margin incurs poor accuracy for large NN models on practical datasets, such as ImageNet. The precision and power of the ADCs should be optimized and adjusted.",

      "abstract":"One of the most key analog blocks in VLSI is probably the buffer amplifier dedicated to driving large off-chip loads. However, achieving fast settling-time and high output current drivability over a wide input voltage range has been challenging with low quiescent current (IQ) consumption. In energy-efficient amplifier designs, many technical breakthroughs have been made to enhance slew-rate (SR) [1-5] and wide unity-gain bandwidth (GBW) [4-6], thus far. However, prior efforts of [1,2], [4-6] might be impractical to use in high-voltage (≥ 5V) actuators and flat-panel displays due to their limited (no rail-to-rail) input range with low supply voltage. Despite obtaining good SR and GBW, the works of [1-3] allowed a considerable overshoot in transient response, which can impose sudden voltage stress on the load. Besides, complex stability compensation in a three-stage amplifier [6] inherently restrains achieving high SR. To overcome such technical limits with optimal transient response, this paper presents a low-IQ ultra-high-SR amplifier with rail-to-rail transconductance (Gm)-boosting technique.",

      "abstract":"There have been many developments in Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) sensors used in Autonomous Driving (AD) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) to measure the precise distance to an object, recognize the shape of an intersection, and classify road types. These LiDAR sensors can achieve fantastic results day and night without any loss of performance. In the past, Time-Correlated Single Photon Counting (TCSPC) and complete digital signal processing (DSP) have been used in to achieve a 100m range Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor [1]. Background (BG) noise-rejection techniques [2] have been used to improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to detection of objects at a 6km range. Single Photon Avalanche Diode (SPAD)-based architectures implement per-pixel level histogramming, Time-to-Digital Conversion (TDC) and signal processing [3,4]. Another ToF sensor has been shown that enables significantly higher resolution, 1200×900 pixels [5]. With the emerging need for a highresolution solid-state LiDAR using a scanning 2D-SPAD array [6], we report a SPAD direct Time-of-Flight (dToF) depth sensor [1-5] to realize long-distance 300m range and high resolution over an automotive-grade temperature range of -40 to 125°C. This microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)-based SPAD LiDAR can measure over ranges up to 150m with 0.1% accuracy for a 10%-reflectivity target and 200m with 0.1% accuracy for a 95%-reflectivity target. This paper presents a back-illuminated stacked SPAD dToF depth sensor deployed with passive quenching and recharge (PQR) frontend circuitry, TCSPC, and on-chip DSP. Under 117klux sunlight conditions, the MEMS-based SPAD LiDAR measures distances up to 200m with 168×63 resolution at 20 frames/s.",

      "abstract":"Bandpass ΔΣ modulators (BPDSMs) are preferred in many RF systems as they can perform digitization at IF frequencies, greatly simplifying the system architecture. The design of a BPDSM has two major challenges. First, it is nontrivial to build a sharp noise transfer function (NTF) at the IF frequency, leading to a limited SQNR. Second, it consumes high power. A BPDSM typically adopts a closed-loop architecture with a bandpass filter (BPF) at its core -[2]. The BPF usually requires multiple wide-band power-hungry amplifiers. To save power, reference [3] implements the BPF by combining passive N-path filters with open-loop amplifiers. However, because its amplifiers still need to process high-frequency signals, and it requires operating many switches and logic gates at the sampling rate, its energy efficiency (Schreier FoM) is limited to 161.7dB despite not counting the clock generator power.",

Users can control smart devices by applying hand gestures to imagers. However, prior efforts suffer from various limitations, such as excessive power consumption, low accuracy, and poor flexibility. The 3D HGR processors -[2] suffer from extremely large power overhead due to the employment of complex image processing, for example using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The grayscale sensor-based SoC [3] consumes less power. However, its accuracy is compromised, especially when the contrast between a hand gesture and the background is low. The infrared sensor-based SoC [4] can recognize 8 dynamic gestures with high accuracy (96%). Nevertheless, the over-simplified algorithm requires hand motion with a fixed gesture type, which limits the number of recognized dynamic gestures. Therefore, an ultra-low-power, flexible, and high accuracy HGR system is required.",

      "abstract":"Although the number of cores is increasing continuously in modern microprocessors for applications such as HPC and AI, the available power is strictly limited by the thermal power budget. To overcome this limitation, recently, each core has been implemented with a dedicated integrated voltage regulator to increase the efficiency of power usage. Distributed digital LDO (DLDO) is a powerful solution for the integrated voltage regulator because it can supply uniform power over the entire core with reduced IR drop and help the thermal management [1- 4]. In the previous distributed DLDOs [1- 3], even though all LDO outputs are connected to drive the power-delivery network, the LDOs operate independently using their own controller, which occupies a large portion of the LDO size. Therefore, the current density in these types of structures is low. In [4], the distributed DLDO uses a dual-loop structure. In this scheme, the high current density can be achieved because the four shared global controllers control the 16 local LDOs (LLDOs) for highly accurate regulation. However, the LLDOs consume large quiescent current since they operate at a switching frequency of several-GHz for a fast transient response. Besides, the load current range is narrow due to the small switching duty-cycle range of the power FETs. Because of these drawbacks, the structure proposed in [4] has limitations in practical applications.",

AI processing capability on such edge devices solves some issues of cloud-only computing systems, such as latency, cloud communication, processing cost, and privacy concerns. The market demand for smart cameras with AI processing capabilities includes small size, low cost, low power and ease of installation. However, conventional CMOS Image Sensors (CIS) only output the raw data of the captured image. Therefore, when developing a smart camera that has AI processing capabilities, it is necessary to utilize ICs that include an image signal processor (ISP), CNN processing, DRAM and so on. Unfortunately, this results in system solution that is larger, higher power and more costly.",

More specifically the FR2 band (24.25 to 52.6GHz) is of a particular interest for both applications. To overcome the high path loss at mm-waves, phased-array systems are used to achieve a certain effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP). The use of numerous radiating elements favours compact structures. The necessity for high-speed mixed-signal and digital circuits in multi-Gb/s communication, entails the use of deep-scaled silicon technologies, enabling low cost, compact, and high-yield CMOS front-end solutions.",

Paper 16.1 describes a high-performance 22nm ReRAM design using a hybrid-precision technique that supports up to an 8b-input and an 8bweight MAC operations, while achieving 11.91TOPS/W for an 8b-input, 8b-weight and 14b-output, and 195.7TOPS/W for a 1b-input, 2b-weight and 4b-output. 16.2 describes the first 1T1C eDRAM design supporting analog 8b-input, 8b-weight and 8b-output computations at 4.76 TOPS/W in a 65nm technology. In 16.3 a 28nm SRAM CIM macro with up to 22.75TOPS/W for a 4b-input, 4b-weight and 12b-output and 94.31TOPS/W for a 8b-input, 8b-weight and 20b-output. 16.4 takes a different approach and focuses on an all-digital SRAM area-efficient CIM macro design achieving up to 89TOPS/W with 4b-input, 4b-weight and 16b-output.",

      "abstract":"In mobile and edge devices, always-on keyword spotting (KWS) is an essential function to detect wake-up words. Recent works achieved extremely low power dissipation down to ~500nW. However, most of them adopt noise-dependent training, i.e. training for a specific signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and noise type, and therefore their accuracies degrade for different SNR levels and noise types that are not targeted in the training (Fig. 9.9.1, top left). To improve robustness, so-called noise-independent training can be considered, which is to use the training data that includes all the possible SNR levels and noise types. But, this approach is challenging for an ultra-low-power device since it demands a large neural network to learn all the possible features. A neural network of a fixed size has its own memory capacity limit and reaches a plateau in accuracy if it has to learn more than its limit (Fig. 9.9.1, top right). On the other hand, it is known that biological acoustic systems employ a simpler process, called divisive energy normalization (DN), to maintain accuracy even in varying noise conditions. In this work, therefore, by adopting such a DN, we prototype a normalized acoustic feature extractor chip (NAFE) in 65nm. The NAFE can take an acoustic signal from a microphone and produce spike-rate coded features. We pair NAFE with a spiking neural network (SNN) classifier chip, creating the end-to-end KWS system. The proposed system achieves 89-to-94% accuracy across -5 to 20dB SNRs and four different noise types on HeySnips, while the baseline without DN achieves a much lower accuracy of 71-87%. NAFE consumes up to 109nW and the KWS system 570nW.",

      "abstract":"Improving robustness to common-mode interference (CMI) is imperative for reliable two-electrode ECG recording. CMI degrades the signal quality in two ways. First, it appears as a differential-mode signal together with the ECG, because of common-mode to differential-mode (CM-DM) conversion. This is often due to the electrode impedance mismatch [1], as contacts inevitably lose their properties differently during long-term recording. Second, CMI that exceeds the supply voltage saturates the amplifier and distorts the recording when the subject is near power lines [4]. To address both of these issues, the recoding IC must withstand large CMI and also have a large total-CMRR (T-CMRR) that includes the effect of electrode mismatch. Unfortunately, prior works provide solutions to only one of them, and thus there is a lack of reliable long-term ECG recording in a practical setting. In [2, 3], CM-DM conversion is addressed by increasing the input impedance in common-mode. However, the IA fails when there is large CMI. In addition, one of the main issues of the input impedance boosting method is that chopping, despite its benefit in 1/f noise reduction, cannot be used, as it reduces the input impedance. Hence, a CM-DM suppression technique that is effective for low input impedance IA is desired. In [4, 5], tolerance to CMI is improved by absorbing the CMI current. However, their T-CMRRs are poor $(\\sim65$ dB). In this work, we propose a CMI-tolerant amplifier with an adaptive CMI-canceling technique. It ensures $\\gt100$ dB of T-CMRR when there is an electrode mismatch of $152k \\Omega$ and CMI of 15V, even when the input capacitance is as large as 120pF.",

      "abstract":"Achieving long-distance, high data-rate wireless connections at the 5G millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequency bands requires ultra-low-jitter local oscillators (LOs) [1]-[3] and phased-arrays with very accurate beam-steering capability [4], [5]. In regard to jitter, digital bang-bang phase-locked loops (BBPLLs) have been recently shown as capable of satisfying the very stringent requirements, while at the same time occupying less area than their analog counterparts [3]. This makes them particularly well-suited to the so-called localized LO-generation approach, where a synthesizer is placed in each of the individual transceiver elements, to avoid routing of a global high-frequency signal across large ICs and to leverage the jitter suppression resulting from an equivalent over-the-air combination of the outputs [1]. To achieve accurate beam-steering with LO phase-shifting, highly linear mm-wave phase-shifters are then conventionally placed on each of the LO signals [4], [5], leading, unfortunately, to a substantial power, noise, and area overhead.",

      "abstract":"MIMO techniques exploit multipath signals from all directions. Unfortunately, this means that all the antennas can be jammed by a single co-channel blocker from any direction. Linear filtering techniques, that have an inverse, can be used to provide RF beamforming when combined with a baseband inverse without losing any of the multipath information. An example of such a filter includes the FFT/IFFT combination, shown in Fig. 6.4.1. Prior techniques have attempted to solve the MIMO co-channel blocker problem by providing nulls in individual directions [1]. These techniques provide finite jammer rejection in only one spatial direction. These have been extended to handle multiple spatial blockers [2]-[4]. However, all these techniques use active circuits for spatial filtering, which limits the ability to handle co-channel interference.",

      "abstract":"Wide-band-gap power devices hold great promise for creating power-conversion systems that are smaller, faster and more energy efficient than silicon power devices. Benefiting from smaller parasitic capacitors and superior conductive characteristics of gallium-nitride (GaN) transistors, the switching frequency (fSW) of power converters can soar to several or even dozens of MHz. Meanwhile, the power efficiency can be significantly improved. However, increasing switching speed leads to large values of di/dt and dv/dt during turn-on transition period, which results in several reliability issues. The turn-on dv/dt will cause a displacement current to charge the CGD Miller capacitance of the complementary switch in half bridge, inducing false turn-on or even shootthrough, and the isolation structure will be influenced by the common-mode transient noise generated by dv/dt. In addition, EMI noise and gate oscillation will be even more severe as the values of di/dt and dv/dt increase.",

      "abstract":"The increasing connectivity of devices in our daily lives has driven the need for higher bandwidth in network and data centers. Recently, we have seen the development of 112Gb/s SerDes, particularly for long-reach interfaces [1- 3]. In high-density switch ASICs, we see an increasing demand to improve both area efficiency (mm2/lane) and signaling efficiencies (pJ/b) [1- 6]. In a switch ASIC, keeping the SerDes power low translates into broader system power savings since additional power and cost for cooling can be limited or even avoided entirely. One path forward to achieve these important system gains is co-packaged optics (CPO) with an extra-short-reach (XSR) interface. In these applications the switch ASIC and optical engine are no more than 50mm apart which represents a total loss of approximately 10dB at 106.25Gb/s.",

      "abstract":"The single-inductor multi-output (SIMO) converter offers the advantage of small size and can provide distributive voltage/current for wearable electronic devices. However, there are still some design challenges to solve. In continuous-conduction-mode (CCM) control, it is difficult to reduce crosstalk between multiple outputs. Any crosstalk will result in excessive or insufficient energy in other outputs, resulting in severe voltage ripple. In the upper left of Fig. 17.7.1, when there is any load change on VO2, crosstalk will occur at VO1 and VO4. On the other hand, in the discontinuous-conduction-mode (DCM) control, if any one of the multiple outputs changes from light load to heavy load, serious crosstalk occurs due to the extension of the switching period TSW, as shown in the upper right of Fig.17.7.1. Although constant frequency control can avoid the expansion of TSW, the limited peak inductor current will reduce the driving capability (ILOAD(MAX) = 100mA). In this paper, the proposed SIMO converter, shown at the bottom left of Fig. 17.7.1, uses an adaptive switchable CCM and DCM (ASCD) technique that takes advantage of the high driving capability of CCM and the advantage of reducing crosstalk in DCM under light loads. To effectively reduce the crosstalk in CCM (Mode1 in this paper), a 5-input crosstalk-reduction error amplifier (CREA) with a feedback rotator is proposed to reduce the shortcomings of hardware overhead. For achieving low crosstalk and high driving capability under medium load, the SIMO converter works in a combination of stacked DCM and sequential DCM, which are classified as Mode2 to Mode4 to change the energy distribution path of each output (Fig. 17.7.1 bottom right). Under ultra-light load conditions, the switching cycle TSW can be extended to reduce switching power loss, and SIMO will enter the ultra-low-power (ULP) mode (Mode5) to further reduce the quiescent current and increase the battery runtime.",

      "abstract":"Photon-count imaging has been proposed as a promising technology to realize image capture with noiseless readout and high dynamic range (HDR) [1]-[7]. In addition, for industrial and scientific applications, a global shutter exposure with motion artifact suppression is essential. A single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) image sensor is well matched to the photon-counting architecture by shrinking the SPAD pixel size and stacking a logic chip with pixel-parallel Cu-Cu connections. A pixel-parallel photon counter, however, requires many counter bits in a pixel for HDR operation. This makes it difficult to shrink the pixel size and lower the power consumption, owing to the substantial number of SPAD activations under high light conditions [2]. Inter-frame mode switching between digital photon count and analog accumulation avoids the power increase under high light conditions, but it suffers from a dip in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and/or motion artifact in reproducing an HDR image [3], [4]. An approach reducing SPAD activations under high light conditions can reduce the power consumption [5]-[7], but the combination of long- and short-exposure frames for HDR [5], [6] still suffers from the dip in SNR like conventional multi-exposure image sensors [8], even if these techniques can suppress motion artifacts owing to sub-frame readout.",

      "abstract":"Mathematically secure cryptographic algorithms leak side-channel information in the form of correlated power and electromagnetic (EM) signals, leading to physical sidechannel analysis (SCA) attacks. Circuit-level countermeasures against power/EM SCA include current equalizer [1], series LDO [2], IVR [3], enhancing protection up to 10M traces. Recently, current domain signature attenuation [4] and randomized NL-LDO cascaded with arithmetic countermeasures [5] achieved >1B minimum traces to disclosure (MTD) with a single and two countermeasures, respectively. Among these, the highest protection with a single strategy is achieved using signature attenuation [4], [6], which utilized a current source making the supply current mostly constant. While being highly resilient to SCA, [4] required analog-biased cascode current sources and an analog bleed path, making it not easily scalable across different technology generations. Conversely, [2], [5] are synthesizable but a single countermeasure only achieved moderate protection (up to 10M MTD). This work embraces the concept of signature attenuation in the current domain, but makes it fully-synthesizable with digital current sources, control loop and the bleed to increase the MTD from 10M [5] to 250M (25x improvement, Fig. 36.2.1) using a single synthesizable countermeasure. Finally, combining the digital signature attenuation circuit (DSAC) with a second synthesizable generic technique in the form of a time-varying transfer function (TVTF), this work achieves an MTD>1.25B for both EM and power SCA.",

      "abstract":"Reduction in base-station deployment costs while increasing coverage has motivated Integrated Access and Backhaul (IAB) nodes in mm-wave 5G NR (Fig. 14.3.1). Similarly, high path loss due to shadowing and limited outdoor-to-indoor penetration at mm-wave has led to an interest in repeater/relays to extend 5G NR coverage [1]. Currently, halfduplex links based on TDD (preferred for IAB), FDD, spatial, and polarization-duplex are explored, targeting mm-wave TX/RX isolation at the cost of channel capacity. While mmwave in-band full-duplex (IBFD) with shared antenna (ANT) interface can enable spectrum reuse in IAB and repeaters/relays, >100dB total self-interference cancellation (SIC) is required with up to 50dB of SIC in the mm-wave front-end [2]. Such SIC has been shown for IBFD at RF [3-5], however mm-wave IBFD SIC with a shared antenna interface has been limited to 20dB at 28GHz and 40dB (22dB at +10dBm TX SI power) at 60GHz [6,7]. Achieving mm-wave IBFD SIC with a shared ANT interface is particularly challenging given (i) the high frequency of operation, (ii) wide 400MHz/800MHz bandwidths targeted in 5G NR, and (iii) variations in beamformer ANT impedance that changes the SI channel. This paper presents a fully integrated mm-wave circulator RX that addresses these challenges using (i) a hybrid-coupler and non-reciprocal N-path filter-based shared ANT interface that provides wideband SIC while creating an SI replica, enabling (ii) subsequent active cancellation with variable gain/phase shift to accommodate SI channel variations. The circulator RX implementation in 45nm SOI CMOS achieves 52.8dB cancellation across 400MHz at 26.4GHz (>100× improvement over state of the art at high power levels) with 3.1dB TX-to-ANT insertion loss (IL) and +11.5dBm TX power-handling. System-level feasibility for mm-wave wideband IBFD is shown with the integrated RX supporting 600MS/s 128-QAM wireless reception (4.2Gb/s) with 3.3% RX EVM in the presence of an in-band 128-QAM 300MS/s (limited by instrument) TX SI signal, and SIC is demonstrated across SI channel changes using a global optimization approach.",

      "abstract":"There are many challenges in building millimeter-Wave (mmW) 5G radios [1] -[3]. Some of the key challenges are the cost, heat dissipation, and array calibration. This paper describes ADI's full line-up of mmW 5G radios used today, with a focus on the millimeter wave front-end portion, and how it addresses some of these challenges. The radio block diagram, shown in Fig. 2.1.1, is an example of a dual-polarized 24-to-30GHz band mmW radio. All ICs in this radio cover 24 to 30GHz, allowing the same chips to be used in n257, n258, and n261 radios, which reduces the development cost. The radio consists of two domains: BB-IF and mmW. The BB-IF domain contains either an IF transceiver utilizing quadrature baseband data converters and mixers to generate the IF, or data converters (MxFE) to directly synthesize the IF. The former is optimal for narrower bandwidth applications while the latter consumes more power but can support higher bandwidths. The mmW domain consists of a mmW Up/Down converter and a 16-channel, (2 polarizations ×8 channels per pol) high-performance beamformer (BF). The mmW chips utilize a 45nm RF SOI process, which is optimized for RF performance at the mmW 5G bands. The SOI process is a 12-inch process, hence economically suitable for large-volume applications. The BF linear output power is 12dBm/channel @ 3% EVM using a 400MHz 5G NR waveform. The channel P1dB is 20dBm. Two mmW BFs, cover 24-to-30 and 37-to-44GHz bands, respectively. An implementation of the mmW front-end, consisting of 128 dual-polarized antenna elements, 16 BFs, 4 Up/Down frequency converters (UDCs), and the power-management circuitry has been fabricated and is shown in Fig. 2.1.2. Over-the-air (OTA) measurement results of the fabricated array are presented below. The measurements include the radiation pattern, EIRP, linearity, and combined throughput of four streams. The paper also discusses the following: OTA Performance of ADI's mmW 5G radios, antenna performance and design aspects, thermal aspects and heat dissipation modelling, and calibration of mmW radios.",

      "abstract":"Electrostatic and piezoelectric actuators are used in a number of mm- and cm-scale robotic applications due to their relatively high energy-density at small size and weight [1-3]. Such transducers typically require high drive voltages (100 to 300V) at relatively low frequencies (<; 1kHz) where they present as dominantly capacitive loads (1's to 10's of nF). Challenges associated with the drive circuits for these devices include: 1) a need to generate a high-voltage drive waveform, often boosted from a low-voltage supply; 2) extreme size (<; 1 cm2) and weight (<; <; 1g) constraints; 3) reactive power (CloadVOUT,pp 2fsw) is typically much higher than real power, i.e., mechanical work done by the actuator [4,5]; 4) solutions often require primary (non-rechargeable) batteries which can source but not sink power. Thus, the ideal actuator driver would supply reactive power efficiently, boosting from a low-voltage supply, but also recover this energy during discharge. To work with primary batteries, residual energy must be stored in passive components rather than returned to the supply.",

The proliferation of 400Gb/s Ethernet (400GbE) in our computing and networking infrastructure is stimulating rapid transformations in our wireline links. A wide array of new technologies are under research to support next-generation 800GbE in the areas of optics, packaging, modulation, coding, and of course transceiver architectures and circuits. Over the past two decades, progress on wireline interface bandwidth scaling has followed a relatively clear path. But, for many, the coming years seem less certain. In this forum, eight experts illuminate the future, sharing their diverse expertise across the broad range of topics that promise to impact optical and electrical transceiver R&D in the 2020’s.",

      "abstract":"Recent SRAM-based computation-in-memory (CIM) macros enable mid-to-high precision multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations with improved energy efficiency using ultra-small/small capacity (0.4-8KB) memory devices. However, advanced CIM-based edge-AI chips favor multiple mid/large capacity SRAM-CIM macros: with high input (IN) and weight (W) precision to reduce the frequency of data reloads from external DRAM, and to avoid the need for additional SRAM buffers or ultra-large on-chip weight buffers. However, enlarging memory capacity and throughput increases the delay parasitics on WLs and BLs, and the number of parallel computing elements; resulting in longer compute latency (tAC), lower energy-efficiency (EF), degraded signal margin, and larger fluctuations in power consumption across data-patterns (see Fig. 16.3.1). Recent SRAM-CIM macros tend to not use in-lab SRAM cells, with a logic-based layout, in favor of foundry provided compact-layout 8T [2], 3, [5] or 6T cells with local-computing cells (LCCs) [4], [6] to reduce the cell-array area and facilitate manufacturing. This paper presents a SRAM-CIM structure using (1) a segmented-BL charge-sharing (SBCS) scheme for MAC operations, with low energy consumption and a consistently high signal margin across MAC values (MACV); (2) An new LCC cell, called a source-injection local-multiplication cell (SILMC), to support the SBCS scheme with a consistent signal margin against transistor process variation; and (3) A prioritized-hybrid-ADC (Ph-ADC) to achieve a small area and power overhead for analog readout. A 28nm 384kb SRAM-CIM macro was fabricated using a foundry compact-6T cell with support for MAC operations with 16 accumulations of 8b-inputs and 8b-weights with near-full precision output (20b). This macro achieves a 7.2ns tAC and a 22.75TOPS/W EF for 8b-MAC operations with an FoM (IN-precision × W-precision × output-ratio × output-channel × EF/tAC) 6× higher than prior work.",

      "abstract":"Next-generation wearable devices will enable clinical-grade, continuous ExG (ECG, EEG, EMG, etc.) biopotential monitoring, providing medical professionals with valuable longitudinal data outside of hospital settings. These devices must be ultra-low power (<; 10μW) to enable long battery life while accurately digitizing sub-kHz, μV-level ExG signals in the presence of large motion and/or stimulation art ifacts (>100mV) with high input-impedance (Zin>10MΩ) to avoid signal attenuation. Achieving such performance with conventional PGA+ADC architectures is challenging due to the conflicting low-power and >90dB dynamic-range (DR) requirements [1]. To address this, several direct digitization analog front-ends (AFEs) have been reported [2-4]. While these offer wide DR, they typically have low input-impedance (<; 5MΩ) and/or low power-efficiency (FoM≤172dB). This paper presents a scalable 2nd-order voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-only ΔΣ ADC that achieves 92.3dB SNDR in a 1kHz bandwidth using a mismatch tolerant, multiphase gated-inverted ring-oscillator (GIRO) quantizer with dynamic powerscaling. The ADC uses an impedance-booster to maintain >50MΩ input-impedance over the entire bandwidth while consuming 4.25μW during nominal operation and 5.8μW in the presence of artifacts resulting in an FoM of 174.7dB.",

      "abstract":"Envelope tracking (ET) is a key technology improving efficiency of RF power amplifiers (PAs) and battery lifetime in mobile handsets. It has been commercialized since 4G LTE era, and is also being employed in 5G NR handsets. A supply modulator (SM) is a circuit generating power supplies of RF PAs for ET and average power tracking (APT) operations. Currently, the maximum channel BW and supported ET BW of 5G NR handset is 100MHz [1-4]. In a short time, over 100MHz BW will be necessary to support intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation cases of n77C/n78C/n79C in 3GPP standard [5]. The required instantaneous maximum output power of SM is about 10W which is calculated by the following parameters: 26dBm output power by power class 2 (PC2), 2dB loss of RF front-end module (FEM) due to complex operating band combinations (EN-DC for non-standalone mode, NE-DC, 2CA/3CA), 6dB higher instantaneous power due to peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) at 1 resource block (RB), 1dB margin, and poor PA efficiency of around 33% (worst example) due to high carrier frequency of 5GHz at n79 band. The poor PA efficiency can be relaxed by high voltage PA design beyond 5V. In [1], a supply modulator with boosted output larger than battery voltage (VBAT) is proposed, and the designed PA with 30% higher voltage shows 10% higher efficiency and broader BW owing to low impedance transformation ratio from 50Ω and small parasitic output capacitance of power cell. The challenge is how to design a supply modulator for 5G NR that can achieve both wide ET BW and high output voltage/power capability, while satisfying high efficiency, low receiver-band noise, short transition time, and multi-mode/standard operation.",

      "abstract":"High-resolution and fast imaging/sensing at THz requires highly directive steerable beams for scanning the object. A coherent array of coupled sources could improve the radiated power but requires mechanical and slow scanning of the object [1]. Phased array systems could use beam steering to scan the object at a higher speed, but in both coherent-array and phased-array systems, large array sizes with high power consumption are needed to generate a highly directive and narrow beam for high image resolution [2-4]. Although Si lens can be used to increase directivity in a phased array, the steering capability is significantly diminished [5]. Therefore, arrays of non-coherent sources are used with Si lens to illuminate different parts of the object with each source with high directivity [6]. The firing angle of each source is determined by the ratio of its displacement (Ldis) from the lens center to the lens radius (Rlens), as shown in Fig. 23.2.1 [1]. However, this type of source can only illuminate the object in discrete steps determined by beam spacing, which in turn is limited by the inevitable distance between adjacent sources on the chip. Being constrained to independent single pixels for illumination leads to loss of resolution and blind spots between the neighboring beams (Fig. 23.2.1). A larger lens can improve the resolution by reducing the beam spacing but at the cost of a smaller total scanning range.",

Since SRAM margins are more vulnerable to the increasing metal resistance, due to smaller critical dimensions, SRAM-assist circuits are proposed to overcome the impact of metal resistance in recent technologies [2 -5]. One of the challenges is the design limitation such as the quantized transistor, which requires SRAM-assist to optimize SRAM margins. In this paper, gate-all-around (GAA) SRAM design techniques are proposed, which improve SRAM margins more freely, in addition to power, performance, and area (PPA). Moreover, SRAM-assist schemes are proposed to overcome metal resistance, which maximizes the benefit of GAA devices.",

      "abstract":"Computing-in-memory (CIM) improves energy efficiency by enabling parallel multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations and reducing memory accesses [1-4]. However, today's typical neural networks (NNs) usually exceed on-chip memory capacity. Thus, a CIM-based processor may encounter a memory bottleneck [5]. Tensor-train (TT) is a tensor decomposition method, which decomposes a d-dimensional tensor to d 4D tensor-cores (TCs: Gk[rk-1, nk, mk, rk], k = 1, ... , d) [6]. Gk can be viewed as a 2D nk×mk array, where each element is an rk-1×rk matrix. The TCs require Σk∈[1,d] rk-1nkmkrk parameters to represent the original tensor, which has Πk∈[1,d] nkmk parameters. Since rk is typically small, kernels and weight matrices of convolutional, fully-connected and recurrent layers can be compressed significantly by using TT decomposition, thereby enabling storage of an entire NN in a CIM-based processor.",

      "abstract":"Noise-shaping SAR (NS-SAR) ADCs are attracting rising attention for their low-power high-resolution capability. In most recent arts, a substantial focus is placed on improving the loop filter design by using techniques such as passive SC and dynamic amps (DAs) [1-2]. While some demonstrate power efficiency reaching 180dB FoMs with medium-high ENOB (~13), NS-SARs targeting >13-ENOB needs have yet to attain this leading efficiency. It calls for further efforts in two key aspects when pushing for higher ENOB. The first is to realize high-order (≥3) NS without significant overhead, so it can use a low OSR and avoid excess digital power. Recent work reports a 4th-order NS-SAR by cascading two 2nd-order EF structures, showing better simplicity over classic single-loop designs [3]. However, the use of static amps keeps power high. Also, due to the fact that its residue voltages (VRES) contain the DC offsets from the comparator/amp, the amp gain needs to be mild, which penalizes the thermal noise. The second need is to minimize the total kT/C noise. kT/C noise is largely unshaped and thus requires large capacitance, especially in the CDAC, to be reduced when high OSR is not desired. This makes the DAC area/power hungry and hard to drive. In the context of standard SAR, ref [4] realizes a kT/C noise cancelling scheme. Nonetheless, it cannot be directly applied to an NS-SAR. Moreover, it needs a power-hungry preamp.",

      "abstract":"The healing process of chronic wounds (CWs) may last for weeks or even months. The process of CW healing relies on many highly regulated factors, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), uric acid (UA), and temperature, which require in-depth observations. Recently, multimodality electrochemistry has been used to acquire biological information pertaining to DNA sequencing [1], neurochemistry research [2] [3], and glucose monitoring [4]. Wound monitoring bandages integrated with modality sensors can provide a comprehensive understanding of the wound healing status [5]. Electrical stimulation has shown several advantages for CW healing, such as increasing the angiogenic response and antibacterial effects, during each healing phase [6]. The temperature index is used to measure the inflammation of the wound. Figure 18.4.1 shows the diagram of the wound healing monitoring bandage. To acquire a large range of biomarkers, the electrochemical instrument must have an extensive operational range, use various scanning methodologies, require low power consumption, and provide high detection resolutions. This work presents a CMOS multimodality system-on-a-chip (SoC) integrated with electrochemical sensors (ECH), a temperature sensor (TS), and a current stimulator (CS).",

Such sensors should be small (<; 10,000μm2) to monitor local hot-spots in dense layouts. They should also be moderately accurate (~1°C) up to high temperatures (≥125°C), so that the system throttling temperature can be set as close as possible to the maximum allowable die temperature. Furthermore, they should be fast (~1kS/s) and consume low power (tens of μW).",

      "abstract":"Intelligent health monitoring devices automatically detect abnormalities in users' biomedical signals (e.g. arrhythmia from an ECG signal or a seizure from an EEG signal) through signal classification. Compared to conventional machine learning methods, neural-network-based AI classification methods are promising in achieving higher classification accuracy, but with significantly increased computational complexity, posing challenges to real-time performance and low power consumption. AI processors have been designed to accelerate neural networks for general AI applications such as image and voice recognition. They are not suitable for biomedical AI processing, which requires a combination of biomedical and AI processing hardware. In addition, the design redundancy for general AI applications results in large power consumption making it unsuitable for ultra-low-power health monitoring devices. There are also some biomedical AI processors such as ECG/EEG/EMG AI processors. However, they are customized for specific algorithms and tasks, prohibiting algorithm upgrades, limiting their applicability. In addition, prior designs lack adaptive learning to address the patient-to-patient variation issue. In this work, the BioAlP is proposed - a reconfigurable biomedical Al processor with adaptive learning. It has the following key features: 1) A reconfigurable biomedical Al processing architecture with reconfigurable neural network and biomedical processing engines to support versatile biomedical Al processing. 2) An event-driven biomedical Al processing architecture and approximate data compression technique to reduce power consumption. 3) An Al-based adaptive-learning architecture to address patient-to-patient variation. 4) A reconfigurable FIR engine reusing the neural-network engine to reduce the hardware overhead.",

      "abstract":"The power consumption of wireline transceivers has become increasingly critical as higher data rates and a larger numbers of lanes per chip are sought [1] -[6]. While attractive for lossy channels, PAM-4 signaling has mostly dictated ADC-based receivers (RXs) and relatively high power consumption [1], [2]. Non-return-to-zero (NRZ) receivers, on the other hand, can be realized in the analog domain, potentially consuming less power, but they must deal with a greater loss. This paper introduces an NRZ RX that achieves more than a twofold reduction in power while exhibiting BER <; 10-12 for a channel loss of 25dB at 28GHz. The proposed design can compete with PAM-4 counterparts and/or serve in 112Gb/s systems that must also support 56Gb/s reception. Figure 11.7.1 shows the RX architecture. The data path consists of a CTLE core, a DFE core, a discrete-time linear equalizer (DTLE) [4], and a DMUX. The receiver performance is greatly improved by a number of feedforward and feedback paths. Also proposed is a half-rate “band-pass” CDR that avoids loading the main data path and the use of quadrature VCOs.",

      "abstract":"Enhancing PA efficiency in the power back-off (PBO) region has become an important design objective due to the high peak-to-average power-ratio (PAPR) modulation in modern communications. Recently, a voltage-mode subharmonic switching (SHS) digital PA architecture has been reported in [1] -[3]. The concept of SHS is to toggle a PA cell at a subharmonic frequency for more efficient PBO operation. However, the dynamic power loss of voltage-mode PAs (e.g., Class-D PAs) increases linearly with the operating frequency [4]. On the other hand, current-mode digital PAs are more suitable for higher carrier frequencies due to their zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) operation to reduce dynamic loss. However, the existing current-mode PA architecture still suffers from poor impedance matching at PBO and conduction loss of the driver, leading to distortion and PBO efficiency degradation. To alleviate those drawbacks, we propose a current-mode SHS PA architecture to reduce conduction loss and minimize output impedance variation, simply by toggling more PA branches at subharmonic frequencies in the PBO region. At the circuit level, we propose a coupled-inductor-based subharmonic trap to achieve the following: 1) derive the optimal load impedance at the carrier frequency (Fc) and high impedance at the subharmonic frequency (Fc/3), 2) reduce the inductor area, 3) achieve common-mode rejection via magnetic field cancellation, 4) avoid voltage reverse biasing of the PA drivers for better reliability, and 5) provide additional attenuation of the subharmonic component caused by the mismatch of phase interleaving [5]. The proof-of-concept prototype achieves 27dBm peak output power at 5.7GHz and 40.1% drain efficiency at 5.4GHz. Due to the current-mode SHS operation, the efficiency peak at -9dB PBO is 29.2% at 5.4GHz, which is a 2× improvement over that of the conventional current-mode digital PA. The real-time SHS operation achieves more than 28% average efficiency with 20/40/80MHz modulation signals.",

      "abstract":"Continued scaling of the transistor increases random Vt variation, which limits the minimum operating voltage (VMIN). Furthermore, fin formation differences between the SRAM bitcells, the peripheral circuits and the standard logic degrade area efficiency due to the empty spaces at fin-to-fin boundary and the required dummy [1]. Memories with small capacities that use the classical SRAM design suffer from this issue the most. In this paper, we will propose a 5nm digital-based SRAM macro with a 16T cell supporting a bit-write-mask operation. We adopted the standard cell rules for the proposed SRAM layout design. The area of the 16T cell is larger than the foundry's 6T SRAM cell; however, the total macro area of a small capacity SRAM is smaller since there is no empty space in the macro and due to its simple peripheral circuit. In addition, the proposed SRAM can be directly abutted with the standard cell region. The proposed SRAM can support ultra-wide range voltage operation due to the advantages of a digital-based bitcell design.",

      "abstract":"The Hexagon™ compute DSP (CDSP) integrates a master VLIW scalar processor and a slave vector coprocessor to enable high-performance and energy-efficient computing for multimedia, voice, audio, vision, imaging, and machine-learning (ML) applications [1]. The master processor executes scalar instruction packets and issues vector instruction packets to the slave coprocessor. The vector coprocessor executes wide-data arithmetic and memory operations for significant processing at the cost of high power. The power delivery for a mobile system-on-chip (SoC) processor consists of a battery that drives a PMIC to generate the SoC supply voltage (VDD) rails. The PMIC voltage regulator (VR) supplies VDD while operating below a peak-current specification (spec). If the CDSP exceeds the peak-current spec for a sustained duration, then the battery and/or PMIC VR may incur a brownout condition where VDD degrades, resulting in circuit failures. Thus, the CDSP requires a current-limiting system to prevent brownout. The latency requirement to detect the current exceeding the peak-current spec and then to respond by operating at a lower current is ~1μs. Also, the SoC must operate within a target thermal design power and temperature with detection and response latencies in 100's of μs and 10's of ms, respectively. Prior current- and temperature-limiting systems lower the phase-locked loop (PLL) clock frequency (FCLK) or reduce VDD and (FCLK) in response to exceeding current or temperature specs. Although these techniques are effective for response latencies above ~10μs, the time to reduce the PLL FCLk or VDD and FCLK far exceeds the ~10μs latency spec. Alternative approaches for satisfying the ~1μs latency target include integrating an adaptive clocking circuit after the PLL [4] or throttling the instruction-issue rate [5] to quickly change performance. These designs satisfy the latency spec by globally reducing performance without considering individual thread power or priority. This paper describes a thread-level power management (TPM) design to adapt the instruction-issue rate based on individual thread power and priority for a current- and temperature-limiting system in a 7nm [6] Hexagon CDSP. The TPM exploits low-power phases during thread execution to adjust the thread instruction-issue rate to achieve a higher performance at a target power as compared to global throttling.",

Due to the relatively low bandwidth, the noise-efficiency of the first OTA has a substantial influence on the power and FoM. OTA-stacking is a recently reported technique that improves the noise-current tradeoff in continuous-time amplifiers [1], [2]. This is the central idea behind the proposed CTΔΣM where an AC-coupled stacked OTA improves the noise-efficiency of the first integrator. The ADC with a 3-stack OTA achieves 100.9dB SNDR and 104.8dB DR in a 24kHz bandwidth while consuming 139μW for a state-of-the-art Schreier FoMDR of 187.2dB.",

      "abstract":"This work demonstrates a novel 1Tb 3D Flash memory chip that has an area efficiency of 10.4Gb/mm2 in a 3b/cell technology. Using a circuit under array (CUA) design technique and over 170 word-line (WL) layers, the chip achieves 33% higher bit density than prior 3b/cell work [1], and better density than in 4b/cell technology [3]. This paper discusses the challenges advanced 3D Flash memories face: using over 100 WL layers results in large parasitic loads and decreases read/program speed, and its complicated operation increases test costs. On the other hand, as high bandwidth is also required, this chip supports a 2.0Gbps IO transfer rate, while maintaining signal integrity. This work introduces four new key technologies to address these difficulties. 1) Asynchronous independent plane read (AIPR), with a 4-plane architecture to improve system-level performance. 2) Enhanced sensing that enables faster read time (tR). 3) IO-DCC (duty cycle correction) training for high-speed DDR operation. 4) A scan chain to improve test coverage and cost effectiveness.",

      "abstract":"Light detection and ranging (lidar) sensors provide high resolution and high accuracy for diverse applications such as autonomous vehicles and three-dimensional imagers. Over the past few years, there has been significant development towards compact, low-power, and low-cost realization of lidars. Recently, silicon-based large-scale optical phased arrays operating at around 1550nm [1 -4] along with their application in lidar [5] [6] have been demonstrated. A major challenge associated with large-scale optical phased arrays is the inevitable mismatches across the array that necessitate array calibration. At present, all large-scale arrays are calibrated by using an external optical detector for measuring focused far-field beam spot intensity [3] or infrared image sensors for measuring the far-field radiation patterns in the lab [1] [2] [6]. This solution, which requires an external detector at a far-field distance, naturally does not lend itself to large-scale field deployment of optical phased arrays for commercial applications with a compact form factor.",

The 48V-to-1V converter, which offers a promising solution to the high-power density data center and automotive applications, is quickly gaining the interest of researchers [1 -4]. The prior state-of-the arts, however, mainly employ Gallium Nitride (GaN) or other discrete switches for 48V-to-1V design, which increases costs and hurts power density. In this work, a 12-level series-capacitor converter adopting on-chip switch and GaN hybrid power conversion is proposed. By exploiting the benefits of low-voltage on-chip transistors, this work reduces component count, increases switching frequency and improves power density.",

      "abstract":"Emerging communication and radar applications place enormous demands on ADC performance by requiring wide BW (100MHz) and high DR (70dB). Continuous-time delta-sigma modulators (CT-DSM) [1-2] are a mainstream solution as they deliver high amplifier efficiency, are easy to drive, and provide innate anti-aliasing. However, CTDSMs have some inherent drawbacks: 1) the loop filter is typically based on RC time-constants which are poorly defined and require digital tuning; 2) they do not scale with sampling frequency; and 3) they are very sensitive to DAC ISI and jitter [2]. Discrete-time (DT) DSMs, such as the emerging noise-shaping (NS) SAR architecture, avoid these problems, but cannot provide the essential benefits of CT-DSMs. We propose the new hybrid-loop (HL) DSM architecture, which combines the advantages of both CT and DT DSMs and eliminates the drawbacks. Moreover, a bandpass, time-interleaved noise-shaping (TINS) SAR quantizer [3] further boosts the new architecture's performance. The prototype HL-DSM provides 68dB SNDR over a 100MHz BW for a quadrature input, without any calibration or tuning, while occupying only 0.09mm2 and consuming 13mW at 1.6GS/s. The resulting 166dB FoMS shows the potential of the HL-DSM as a more robust and practical alternative to CT-DSM.",

General-purpose computing has derived performance gains from clock frequency and instructions-per-clock for over four decades; achieving an impressive ∼105 performance increase over the same timeframe. With the future of the traditional computing roadmap in doubt, this event will discuss what other technologies could help shape the future of computing. How much further can we push traditional CPU micro-architectures? Will 3D integration help extend the traditional roadmap for another decade? Will dedicated accelerators become mainstream alternatives for everyday computing tasks? Can memory materials or architectures provide a performance breakthrough for traditional architectures and what if error-free memory is no longer a constraint?",

      "abstract":"The noise-shaping (NS) SAR is an emerging hybrid architecture that aims to combine the benefits of both SAR and ΔΣ ADCs [1-8]. The key in an NS SAR is the NS filter. As shown in Fig. 27.1.1, prior NS filter techniques can be classified into two types. The first way is to use a closed-loop amplifier-based integrator [1-3]. With sufficient gain of the amplifier, this type of integrator can realize a sharp noise transfer function (NTF). However, the high-gain multi-stage amplifier produces large noise, is power-consuming and unfriendly to technology scaling [2,3]. The second way is to use passive charge sharing to perform error feedback [4-6] or integration [7,8]. The fully passive filter avoids using closed-loop amplifiers, but it has signal attenuation issue and the resulting NTF is mild [4]. Also, due to the lack of effective gain, it suffers from large comparator noise. To improve the NTF and noise suppression capability, some works place an open-loop amplifier before the passive filter [5-7], or implement a passive gain after it [8]. However, the gain of an open-loop amplifier is sensitive to PVT variations, and the passive gain method suffers from severe parasitic effects when a large gain is required.",

      "abstract":"3D vision is an increasingly important feature in many applications of consumer, automotive, industrial, and medical imaging. Long range, high depth resolution, high spatial resolution, and high frame rates, are often conflicting requirements and difficult to be simultaneously achieved, especially in extreme ambient light conditions. In order to address range and depth resolution, direct time-of-flight has emerged as a powerful technique to perform light detection and ranging (LiDAR), thanks to advances in low-jitter optical detectors, such as single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs), and accurate time-to-digital converters (TDCs) [1]-[5]. High spatial resolution can be achieved using scanning, at a cost of system complexity and somewhat lower frame rates [1], [3], while FLASH sensors [2], 4, [5] offer an alternative for both high frame rates and large pixel counts, but at limited ambient light conditions, due to typically long exposure times.",

This paper presents a video processor that supports the AV1 standard via a Multi-Format video Decoder (MFD). An MFD can decode various video coding standards, such as H.264/AVC, HEVC and AV1. The video decoder can decode up to 8K Ultra HD (8K-UHD) video at 30fps at 468MHz core clock frequency. The MFD is fabricated using a state-of-the-art 5nm CMOS process with a 5,835k NAND2 equivalent gate count and 518kB SRAM. For AV1, MFD dissipates 116mW for decoding AV1 7680x4320p video at 30fps (0.12nJ/pixel) with core operating voltage at 0.7V.",

      "abstract":"Phased arrays have demonstrated great potential in 5/6G communication, radar and sensor applications [1 -4]. To achieve excellent performance, phased arrays require lownoise and high-linearity front-ends [5]. Most importantly, arrays demand uniform performance from all elements for optimum receiving G/T value and transmission effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) [6]. Figure 14.7.1 exemplifies it with an array whose antenna element has 3dBi uniform gain on one side and no radiation on the other side. When all elements in an 8×1 linear array with a λ/2 space have identical characteristics, the array presents a 19dBi gain in the normal direction. Any temperature change in the array can be decomposed into an absolute temperature change superposed with a relative temperature variation. When the absolute temperature increases, the frontend gain decreases by as much as -0.1dB/°C [1]. When there is non-uniform solar radiation or heat generation inside the array, the relative temperature variation may present a gradient or a parabolic distribution. Taking a 64×1 array as an example, when there is a gain/phase mismatch with an average value of 0.125dB/1.25° between adjacent elements in a parabolic distribution locating at the center of the array, the formed beam presents a 1.4dBi main-lobe reduction in the normal direction and an 11.9dBi side-lobe degradation, shown in Fig. 14.7.1. It also shows an active array receiver front-end highlighting all the temperature-sensitive blocks. Calibration can adjust temperature-dependent performances [7]. However, periodic calibration inevitably takes time overhead and prevents array systems from full-time operations. Digital background calibration allows systems to operate uninterrupted, but may induce antenna boresight instability due to abrupt gain/phase change. In contrast, analog background calibration like adaptive healing design can resolve the above issues [8]. In this paper, we present an adaptive analog temperature healing receiver front-end with ±0.005dB/°C gain variation from -15 to 85°C environment temperature for a 17.7-to-19.2GHz phased array.",

      "abstract":"Wi-Fi is the most ubiquitous wireless networking technology for IoT in homes, offices, and businesses. Since the power of Wi-Fi transceivers (10s-to-100s of mW) can be prohibitively high for emerging classes of IoT devices (which desire <; 100μW), recent work has suggested piggybacking baseband signals from the IoT device directly on top of incident Wi-Fi signals generated by access points (APs) via Wi-Fi-compatible backscatter modulation [1-4], where as low as 28μW of active power has been demonstrated [4]. However, the major limitation of this approach is range: signals generated by the transmitting AP experience 1/d2 path loss to the backscattering tag, which has insertion loss PL,ins to perform single-side band (SSB) modulation, and then re-radiated modulated signals back to the receiving AP (or to another AP) experience an additional 1/d2 path loss, resulting in an overall loss ∝ 1/d4 + PL,ins. With no active RF amplification, the tag in [4] experienced PL,ins=15dB, limiting AP-to-tag-and-back-to-AP distance to ~10m, which is not sufficient in many single-AP homes.",

      "abstract":"The extensive integration of electronics into tissue-penetrating probes improves the signal quality and reduces parasitic effects for high-density recording of it in vivo neural activity. In contrast to passive neural probes or devices implementing only part of the signal chain in the probe shank, fully immersible subcortical probes allow the recording of neural signals in deep-brain regions. This is achieved by directly digitizing brain activity in situ, thus avoiding a large base and allowing the probe to have a base and shank of equal width. However, this comes with a lower spatial resolution and an increased power density in the probe shank. To advance the concept of fully immersible probes, neural recording front-end architectures are required that reduce not only the area, but also the power per channel, thus avoiding tissue overheating due to increased power density. This paper presents a modular neural-recording front-end, which achieves these goals while also enhancing the noise and linearity performance compared to the state of the art.",

N-path filters and mixer-first receivers [1- 3] achieve sharp filtering and good linearity but can suffer from high LO leakage (> -70 dBm), which is not compliant with the FCC requirements [4]. In addition, they do not support multi-carrier operation very well [5].",

      "abstract":"Millimeter-wave beamforming transmitters use antenna arrays to increase the EIRP by focusing the radiation pattern into a direction chosen by programming the TX phase shifters. However, under sharp scanning angles, the antennas load each other (see Fig. 26.4.1) such that in each antenna path the load seen by an individual PA in the output matching network (OMN) deviates from the load corresponding to boresight transmission. This situation can be accompanied by other external factors, such as antenna blockage, that increase VSWR. To restore the PA performance under increasing VSWR conditions, one can use a tunable matching network (TMN) that is controlled by the observed VSWR. The latter is then measured by a VSWR sensor, which is presented here. The overhead of such a sensor in terms of form factor, power consumption, and TX performance degradation should be minimal. The sensor described here can measure reflection coefficients with a magnitude of up to 0.7 (corresponding to a VSWR of 5.7) at 28GHz. It detects the complex voltage difference over a 235fF sensing capacitor that is inserted in the signal path at the PA output. The magnitude and phase of this voltage vary with the complex reflection coefficient Γ and are detected separately. The loading effect of the rest of the sensor can be modelled as a 32fF shunt capacitor added to the matching network, equivalent to an extra insertion loss of less than 0.2dB.",

In low-cost systems such as sensor nodes, unified implementations of TRNGs and/or PUFs have been demonstrated to reduce their cost and area, thanks to circuit reuse across two different functions, such as a TRNG with a PUF in a single standalone macro [1], and a TRNG with a data converter [2]. Similarly, SRAM-based PUFs have been widely explored and commercially used to exploit their omnipresent availability, and their high PUF key density per unit area (e.g., [3], [4]). However, existing SRAMs are not able to assume the function of a TRNG, and their PUF operation is limited to one bit per bitcell at most, whereas multi-bit/cell operation is currently restricted to non-SRAM PUFs [5].",

      "abstract":"Wireless sensor nodes in battery-powered internet-of-things (IoT) applications require a stable on-chip frequency reference with low energy (<; 10pJ/cycle) and high frequency stability (below ±300ppm). CMOS RC frequency references are promising due to their low-cost integration and high energy efficiency [1-5]. Conventional RC references, however, achieve only moderate accuracy (a few %) due to the large temperature coefficient (TC) of on-chip resistors [3]. First-order TC compensation can be achieved by combining resistors with complementary TCs [1,2]. Although this is energy efficient (<; 6pJ/cycle), it only partially compensates for the resistors' high-order TCs, limiting the resulting accuracy to about ±500ppm. Better accuracy (±100ppm [4]) can be achieved by using the output of a digital temperature sensor (TS) to perform a polynomial correction of the phase-shift (μp,T) of an RC filter (Fig. 31.2.1). Alternatively, the phaseshifts (μP and μN) of two RC filters with complementary TCs can be linearized (TP and TN) and combined in the digital domain. Such dual-RC frequency references can also achieve good accuracy (±200ppm [5]). However, both architectures employ an analog phase-domain ΔΣ modulator (Φ-ΔΣM) for each RC filter, which consumes significant energy (25pJ/cycle [4] and 107pJ/cycle [5]) and area (0.3mm2 [4] and 1.65mm2 [5]).",

      "abstract":"3D imaging technologies have become prevalent for diverse applications such as user identification, interactive user interfaces with AR/VR devices, and self-driving cars. Direct time-of-flight (D-ToF) systems, LiDAR sensors, are desirable for long-distance measurements in outdoor environments because they offer high sensitivity to weak reflected light and high immunity to background light thanks to the spatiotemporal correlation of SPADs [1], [2]. SPAD-based LiDAR sensors suffer from a large amount of ToF data generated by complicated time-to-digital converters (TDC), resulting in limited spatial resolution and frame rate compared with indirect ToF (I-ToF) sensors. Recently, LiDAR sensors embedding histogramming TDCs have been reported to generate depth information to reduce the required output bandwidth [3]-[6]. However, they still adopt a large number of memories in pixel, a complicated signal processor, or a column-parallel TDC scheme with scanning optics.",

      "abstract":"A high-order CTDSM can provide high resolution with a small OSR, but its design suffers from a few challenges. First, it requires a large number of OTAs [1]. This increases the design complexity and power. In addition, each OTA contributes extra phase delay, whose reduction requires increasing the OTA BW, further increasing power. Second, it is harder to stabilize, especially considering PVT variations. For example, a slight change in the RC time constant can cause instability. One way to address these issues is to use a passive discrete-time (DT) noise-shaping (NS) SAR ADC as quantizer [2], [3]. In [2], a 3rd-order DSM is built with only 1 OTA and a 2nd-order NS-SAR. Since it is set by device ratios, the NTF of a NS-SAR is PVT-robust. Hence, the 3rd order DSM stability is equivalent to that of a 1storder CTDSM, which is easy to ensure. Nevertheless, because its CT front-end provides only 1st-order shaping, it cannot provide sufficient suppression for noises coming from later stages, limiting its SNDR to 70dB. Reference [3] increases the CT front-end order to 2 by using a single-amplifier-biquad (SAB), but its NS-SAR is only 1st-order with a mild zero at 0.5, which limits its achievable resolution. Overall, both [2] and [3] achieve only 3rd order shaping with a Schreier FoM limited to 171dB.",

      "abstract":"In recent years, there has been growing demand for high-resolution and large-format CMOS image sensors in Digital Still Camera, Security, and Factory Automation uses. In addition, new uses such as airborne mapping [1] are now being reported. Focusing on the camera market, there is currently demand for simultaneously realizing high image quality, high frame rate, and low power consumption, all within a larger-than-APS-C format. For most cases, the single-slope ADC (SS ADC) [2] architecture is used in commercialized CMOS image sensors. In order to accelerate frame rate, the counting-clock frequency can be increased up to 2.376GHz as demonstrated in [3], but maintaining clock waveform quality without increasing power is a major challenge for low-power operation. Adaptive gain operation using a dual gain amplifier is reported in [4], but SS ADCs based on adaptive gain operation still have frame rate issues from increasing bit resolution, e.g., to 14b.",

      "abstract":"Limited by battery capacity, advanced MCUs for IoT applications require ultra-low power consumption. In a conventional design, most modules except the crystal oscillator (XO32), real-time clock (RTC), and retention memory are turned off to reduce the current in sleep state, but the sleep power still accounts for most of the total power consumption. When the load current is reduced to ~100nA, the transient current of a switched-capacitor voltage regulator (SCVR) remains unchanged (~100nA), so that power efficiency is low and the sleep current cannot be reduced further. Voltage stacking has been proposed to address power efficiency [1,2]. Prior voltage stacking architectures could not realize dynamic switching between flat mode and stack mode, leading to high dynamic power in the normal state. In addition, the SCVR still consumes some power during the sleep state [3]. This paper proposes a dynamic voltage-stacking scheme, which supports two operating modes: a flat mode in the normal state and a stack mode in the sleep state. In the flat mode, the retention memory, RTC, and XO32 are connected in parallel and are powered by the SCVR. In the stack mode, the four instances are connected in series, including the SRAM1 (level1), the SRAM2 (level2), the XO32, and the RTC (level3), and the on-chip SCVR is shut down for power saving.",

      "abstract":"Super resolution is the process of reconstructing a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) one. Super-resolution technology enables high-resolution video streaming, image zoom-in, and far object recognition. Fig. 4.7.1 shows such an application scenario. The details of the videos/images can be reconstructed and projected to a higher-resolution screen, thereby providing a better visual experience. A hardware accelerator is needed to speed up the super-resolution process to support real-time high-resolution video streaming. Conventionally, dictionary-based approaches, such as ANR/GR and A+, convert the LR image into the HR one from learned mapping functions. Neural network (NN)-based algorithms generate better-quality super-resolution images by extracting features from training. However, the complexity of the dictionary-based and the NN-based algorithms is excessively high, making them unsuitable for high-speed applications. A rapid and accurate image super resolution (RAISR) algorithm is proposed to achieve comparable quality with a much faster processing speed when compared to the previous solutions. It employs pre-learned filters to enhance the image quality based on bicubic interpolation. A pre-learned filter (also known as kernel) is selected by a hash function to address the structure-related details.",

      "abstract":"As data center and telecommunication infrastructure bandwidth requirements continue to increase, networking products with 112Gb/s electrical and optical transceivers are beginning to ramp up to support 400GE and beyond. At the same time, the industry is starting to explore paths of scaling high-speed links with data rates greater than 200Gb/s. This session starts with two papers describing the design of ≥200Gb/s PAM-4 transmitters, one using a DSP/DAC approach in 10nm CMOS and another using an analog approach in 28nm CMOS. Another paper pushes the energy efficiency and chip area of a 112Gb/s DSP/DAC-based transmitter. Three papers in this session describe complete 112Gb/s PAM-4 electrical transceivers with emphasis on reconfigurability, power efficiency improvements, link robustness over voltage/temperature variations, and new techniques to support higher channel loss. One paper addresses DAC and ADC design for 400Gb/s coherent optical links. The session concludes with a paper describing a method to implement a large number of DFE taps in an ADC/DSP-based 112Gb/s PAM-4 receiver.",

      "abstract":"Modern wireless communication systems in portable devices require transmitters (TXs) with watt-level output power (Pout), high data-rate, and high efficiency, especially at power back-off (PBO) for enhanced average efficiency. CMOS digital TXs demonstrate high integration and high efficiency at low cost, which are attractive attributes in practical applications. Compared to polar TXs, quadrature TXs [1-6] show the advantages of a simpler architecture (without CORDIC and phase modulator) and higher data-rates. IQ cell sharing is used to increase the peak efficiency of quadrature TXs [2]. Besides, to achieve enhanced efficiency at PBO, various techniques are developed for digital TXs and digital power amplifiers (DPAs), such as Class-G Doherty [4], load modulation [5], hybrid Doherty with impedance boosting [6], 8 way-combined switched-capacitor power amplifier (SCPA) with a switched transformer [7], and time-interleaving Class-G Doherty [8], etc. In this work, a watt-level switched/floated-capacitor power amplifier (SFCPA) using reconfigurable self-coupling canceling transformer and IQ cell sharing is proposed, which achieves efficiency enhancement at 3/6/9/12/15dB PBOs in the complex domain without any supply switching.",

      "abstract":"DSP-based transceivers above 100Gb/s have demonstrated the ability to handle up to 38dB insertion loss (IL) with low-to-moderate crosstalk [1-2]. At same time, power scaling techniques [3] have closed the energy efficiency gap compared with analog/mixed-signal transceivers on shorter links. Notwithstanding advances in materials and connectors, in large repeater-less backplanes, transceivers are required to operate reliably at 100Gb/s with more than 40dB IL. Furthermore, next generation computing and AI applications require 50Gb/s rates per lane on channels with more than 45dB loss but without the latency of forward error correction (FEC). In this paper we demonstrate a reconfigurable ADC-DSP SerDes capable of operating with BER ≤1E-05 at 112Gb/s in PAM-4 or Duo-PAM-4 across a 45dB loss channel, and 58Gb/s PAM-2 at <; 1E-15 over a 52dB loss channel without FEC, while achieving a power efficiency better than 6pJ/b. The SerDes architecture is shown in Fig. 8.4.1 and features extensive power scaling capability.",

      "abstract":"Recent works on mobile deep-learning processors have presented designs that exploit sparsity [2, 3], which is commonly found in various neural networks. However, due to the shift in the machine learning community towards using non-sparse activation functions such as Leaky ReLU or Swish for better training convergence, state-of-theart models no longer exhibit the sparsity found in conventional ReLU-based models (Fig. 9.3.1, top). Moreover, contrary to error-tolerant image classification tasks, more difficult tasks such as image super-resolution require higher precision than plain 8b integers not just for training, but for inference without large accuracy degradation (Fig. 9.3.1, bottom). These changes offer new challenges faced by mobile deep-learning processors: they must process non-sparse networks efficiently and maintain higher precision for more challenging tasks.",

      "abstract":"Resistor-based temperature sensors can achieve higher resolution and energy-efficiency than traditional BJT-based sensors. To reach similar accuracy, however, they typically require 2-point (2-pt) calibration, compared to the low-cost 1-pt calibration required by BJT-based sensors. This paper presents a hybrid temperature sensor that uses an inherently accurate, but power-hungry, thermal-diffusivity (TD) sensor [1] to selfcalibrate an inaccurate, but efficient, resistor-based sensor [2]. The use of an on-chip reference obviates the need for accurate temperature stabilized ovens or oil baths, drastically reducing calibration time and costs. Furthermore, by sharing most of the readout circuitry, the associated area overhead can be reduced. After self-calibration at room temperature (RT, -25°C) and at an elevated temperature (-85°C), the proposed hybrid temperature sensor achieves an inaccuracy of 0.25°C (3σ) from -55°C to 125°C.",

The first paper describes a retinal prosthetic that utilizes an optically-addressed nanowire array in conjunction with a transmitter-offloaded wireless neural stimulation approach for efficient operation near sensitive retinal tissue. A pneumatic-free fully-CMOS-controlled microfluidics platform for label-free cellular and bio-molecular sensing comes next, followed by a CMOS microscopic-scale thermal actuation and sensing array for localized heating of magnetic nanoparticles for hyperthermia cancer therapy. The final paper showcases a wireless multimode IC integrating electrochemical sensors, a temperature sensor, and a current stimulator for monitoring chronic wound healing processes.",

      "abstract":"We present a 0.4-to-6.5GHz Frequency Locked Loop (FLL) implemented in 10nm CMOS, targeting high performance SoCs that require uninterrupted, overshoot-free clocks for Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). The FLL supports gradual frequency transitions (e.g. up to 650MHz per 100ns) where di/dt constraints prevail. When unconstrained, transitions between any two frequencies in 100ns with <; 1% exit frequency error are possible. Adaptive Frequency Synthesis (AFS), with 0.5-to-1.0ns reaction time, helps mitigate guardbands induced by computation-dependent supply droop [1]-[3]. Split analog and digital supplies (each driven by a low drop out regulator (LDO), see Fig. 29.3.1) and duty cycle adjustment (DCA) improve output jitter performance and clock quality.",

      "abstract":"Incorporating different wavelength (400 to 1000nm) LEDs, photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors allow wearable devices to monitor various health parameters such as heart rate (HR), oxygen saturation (SpO2), and blood pressure (BP). Nowadays, PPG sensing technology at the wrist is well established. To cope with the large degree of motion turbulence presented at the wrist, PPG sensors use Green (Gr) LEDs together with multiple photodiodes (PD), and they are driven by wide-dynamic-range (DR) current-sensing front-ends [1]. It is attractive to use a near-infra-red (nIR) PPG sensor in a True Wireless Stereo (TWS), as the ear provides the best site to measure heart rhythm (more blood flow, constant distance from the heart, and less motion than at the finger or wrist). However, TWS requires a PPG sensor that is more stringent on size and power consumption (shown in Fig. 28.2.1). A promising solution [2,3] is integrating an array of PDs with an ADC to dramatically reduce power while also providing monolithic integration. However, the limited DR (<; 80dB) and the poor spectral responsivity remain challenging. This work advances [1] by demonstrating a CMOS monolithic PPG sensor, and improves spectral responsivity more than 4× (0.3A/W across 400 to 1000nm) compared to [2]. The sensor is fabricated by back-side illumination (BSI) CMOS technology providing 90dB DR (18dB improvement from [3]) while consuming only 24μW power and 5.5mm2 silicon area.",

      "abstract":"The recent development of the 5th-generation (5G) communication sytems has set increasingly strict requirements on the spectral purity of millimeter-wave (mm-wave) local oscillators (LO). Low phase noise is crucial to enable advanced modulation formats for high communication data-rates. Much effort has been made to improve the phase noise performance of the mm-wave LOs. A lower frequency voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) together with a frequency multiplier can lower the phase noise [1]; however, the high-order harmonic components in VCOs are usually very weak, which requires additional power-consuming mm-wave amplification stages to satisfy the LO swing requirement. For single mm-wave fundamental VCOs, the minimal achievable phase noise is bounded by the smallest realizable inductor that displays a high Q factor. To avoid the “small inductor” problem, N oscillators with relatively large inductors can be coupled together to improve the phase noise by 10log10(N) [2-5]. Authors in [2] presented a quad-core bipolar VCO working around 15GHz as shown in Fig. 20.3.1 (Left), where four one-turn inductors are star-connected with the active cores placed in the middle. Resistors (Rc) are added to avoid undesired multi-tone concurrent oscillations. However, the four one-turn inductors still suffer from the Q-factor drop when the inductance decreases, thus limiting the highest achievable oscillation frequency. Besides, VDD at the inductor central taps and VSS at the tail current source are far from each other, making the VDD-VSS current return path long. This path has to be carefully modeled in simulations, especially in the mm-wave frequency range, where the return path inductance is comparable to the tank inductance. Instead of the star-connected topology, authors in [3] presented a circular-connected quad-core VCO working close to 30GHz, where the inductors are arranged in a circular topology as shown in Fig. 20.3.1 (Middle). The destructive coupling between the inner edges inside a small inductor is eliminated. Therefore, the minimal realizable inductance is further reduced while keeping a high Q factor. The central taps are connected by narrow metal traces to avoid latching and mode ambiguity. The VCO adopts a CMOS configuration, which limits the highest operating frequency. It would be difficult for this topology to be adopted in NMOS-only VCOs because the central taps have to be resistively isolated to suppress unwanted modes; therefore, they cannot be connected to the AC-ground power supply simultaneously as required by the NMOS-only configuration. Due to the lack of harmonic impedance control in the circular inductors, extra tail filtering transformers are added to improve the phase noise.",

      "abstract":"Over the past years, the constant reduction in the size of consumer electronics has strengthened the demand for fully integrated power management circuits. Buck converters offer high efficiency, but they cannot satisfy the stringent size requirements because bulky off-chip inductors are required [1]. Switched-capacitor (SC) approaches provide fully integrated power management solutions; however, their power density is limited by the on-chip capacitance density [2]. Resonant switched capacitor (ReSC) converters need 3D die-stacked inductors or PCB-integrated inductors to achieve appropriate power density values, posing challenges for monolithic integration [3]. A fully integrated ReSC has been presented [4], which implements an on-chip resonator, avoiding any external or 3D stacked passive components. However, the switching losses associated with the four transistors driving the resonator limit the switching frequency to 10s of MHz, bounding the power density scaling to 0.097W/mm 2.",

      "abstract":"The spectrum above 100GHz is expected to spawn a generation of ultra-high-speed wireless links and intelligent sensing and imaging applications. They are meant to be supported through a heterogeneous and dynamically reconfigurable wireless network fabric in 5G and beyond. Such wireless communication and sensing applications require rapid localization and direction finding of mobile nodes [1]. This functionality is paramount for communications-on-the-move applications, wireless link discovery, and rapid beam alignment/tracking at mm-wave and THz frequencies [2]-[9]. The current protocols for direction finding and beam alignment in 5G mm-wave systems are based on iterative algorithms that are often non-scalable, time-consuming, and computationally expensive, posing serious challenges for low-latency applications. Thus there is a need to process such direction-finding methods at the `edge nodes', to enable secure scalable networks with very low latencies [10]. In this article, we present a spectrum-to-space mapping principle, where localization information can be processed at the edge `sensor node' through the spectrum sensing. The conceptual idea is presented in Fig. 22.1.1, which shows an access point (transmitter/receiver) that acts as a THz prism casting different spectral portions of a broadband THz signal across space. If the mapping is unique, multiple edge nodes can simultaneously localize themselves in a single-shot fashion through localized spectrum sensing, avoiding the use of the slow iterative process and bi-directional communication. In this paper, we present a scalable 360-to-400GHz transceiver architecture in 65nm CMOS with frequency-dependent beam synthesis using two dual-port integrated frequency-dispersive leaky-wave antennas. The two antennas when excited/sensed across the two opposite end-ports, cover a 1D spatial angle $across \\pm 40^{\\circ}$, and enable 2D localization with two such ICs covering both orthogonal basis vectors with a frequency-offset radiation (Fig. 22.1.1). Exploiting the cross-correlation of the spectrum-to-space mapping (Fig. 22.1.1), the system achieves 2D localization accuracy of $\\sigma_{\\varphi},= 1.9$ ° and $\\sigma_{theta}= 1.95^{\\circ}$ for a measurement resolution bandwidth (RBW) of 20Hz.",

      "abstract":"As the amount of information that wireless communication devices carry increases more than ever, the importance of data transmission speed and efficiency has drastically increased. Thus, the need has emerged for high-data-rate, low-power communication. Impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) technology is considered a suitable candidate for such needs. The latest studies have introduced various techniques to increase data rate as well as communication range while reducing power consumption, notably analog frequency hopping (AFH), which increases communication distance by increasing pulse energy [1], multiband IR-UWB communication that utilizes high-order modulation techniques to obtain the Gb/s data rate [2]-[3], and digitalized multi-pulse-position modulation (D-MPPM) [4] to mitigate the dependence of the data rate on the symbol period for low-power high-speed communication. However there is still room to achieve lower power, while maintaining Gb/s speeds, and proper radio-range communication. This work proposes several techniques to achieve Gb/s data rates while maintaining tens of mW of power consumption and a few meters of communication range. Firstly extended multi-pulse-position modulation (E-MPPM) is proposed to increase data rate, secondly a high-conversion-gain cross-coupled envelope detector is proposed for improving the sensitivity and finally, a new digital frequency-hopping (DFH) technique is proposed to increase radio range by increasing pulse energy.",

      "abstract":"Computing-In-Memory (CIM) techniques which incorporate analog computing inside memory macros have shown significant advantages in computing efficiency for deep learning applications. While earlier CIM macros were limited by lower bit precision, e.g. binary weights in [1], recent works have shown 4-to-8b precision for the weights/inputs and up to 20b for the output values [2, 3]. Sparsity and application features have also been exploited at the system level to further improve the computation efficiency [4, 5]. To enable higher precision, bit-wise operations were commonly utilized [3, 4]. However, there are limitations in existing solutions using the bit-wise operations with SRAM cells. Fig. 15.3.1 shows the summary of challenges and solutions in this work. First, all existing solutions utilize 6T/8T/10T SRAM as a CIM cell, which fundamentally limits the size of the CIM array. In this work, we replace the commonly used SRAM cell with a 3-transistor (3T) analog memory cell, referred as dynamic-analog-RAM (DARAM) which represents a 4b weight value as an analog voltage. This leads to ~10× reduction in transistor count and achieves an effective CIM single-bit area smaller than the foundry-supplied 6T SRAM cell. Secondly, as no bit-wise calculation is needed in this work, only single-phase MAC operations are performed, removing the throughput degradation associated with previous multi-phase approaches and digital accumulation in [3, 4]. Furthermore, analog linearity issues are mitigated by highly linear time-based activation, removal of matching requirements for critical multi-bit caps [4, 6], and a special read current compensation technique. Thirdly, to mitigate the power bottleneck of ADC or SA, this work applies analog sparsity-based low-power methods, which include a compute-adaptive ADC skipping operation when the analog MAC value is small (or “sparse”) and a special weight-shifting technique, leading to an additional ~2χ reduction in CIM-macro power. We demonstrate the proposed techniques using a 65nm CIM-based CNN accelerator showing state-of-art energy efficiency.",

On-chip sensors that handle guard band in terms of process (VPGB), voltage, temperature (VTGB), and aging (VAGB) are designed for power enhancement in dynamic frequency and voltage scaling (DVFS). A process sensor (P-sensor) is used to determine per-die VPGB for Smartphone operation voltage (Vsov) with machine learning (ML). A temperature sensor (T-sensor) senses run-time local thermal and temperature inversion (T-inversion) to scale VTGB in DVFS. An aging sensor (A-sensor) converts cell degradation to corresponding VAGB for aging compensation. Lastly, a voltage sensor (V-sensor) sustains system stability against supply noise.

The first two papers in this session present different techniques in continuous-time Δ Σ ADCs for audio applications and achieve impressive figures of merit. The third paper describes a new hybrid CT/DT loop architecture for a Δ Σ modulator without requiring any calibration or tuning. The fourth paper proposes a CT loop filter with DT noise shaping achieving $4^{{th }}$ -order noise shaping using a single OTA. The fifth paper introduces a pipelined ADC with a 1st stage SAR and $2^{{nd }}$ stage $2 x$ -time-interleaved CT incremental Δ Σ ADC. The last two papers in this session describe techniques utilized to achieve high-linearity multi-GHz DACs. The sixth paper describes a 16GS/s DAC for software radio base stations. The last paper presents a 64GS/s DAC for BIST of RF sampling ADCs.",

      "abstract":"The use of THz signals for imaging and sensing, enabling numerous applications in object characterization, medical, security, and other fields, has gained large interest in recent years. Both THz transmitters and receivers have been successfully implemented in commercial CMOS technologies, bringing numerous advantages: low cost, the possibility of integration with standard digital logic, and high yield. Nevertheless, efficient power generation in silicon technologies is still a challenge above the maximum frequency of oscillation (fmax). Therefore, improving the sensitivity of terahertz detectors is crucial. As fmax in CMOS is saturating, new circuit architectures are required for efficient and sensitive THz detection. So far, Schottky Barrier Diodes and self-mixing MOSFETs have been the most successful topologies in CMOS above 500GHz, attaining noise-equivalent powers (NEP) around 10pW/√Hz [5-9]. The presented work breaks this barrier and achieves a minimum NEP of 2.3pW/√Hz at 605GHz.",

      "abstract":"The demand for mobile DRAM has increased, with a requirement for high density, high data rates, and low-power consumption to support applications such as 5G communication, multiple cameras, and automotive. Thus, density has increased from 2Gb [1] to 16Gb [2] in LPDDR4 and LPDDR4X, but the maximum density for LPDDR5 is only 12Gb [3] due to the limited package size specification: such as a 496-ball FBGA. In this work, a mosaic architecture is introduced to increase the density to 16Gb, even in a limited package size. Additionally, the I/O performance is improved by shortening the length for the top metal, and a short-feedback sense amplifier (SA) with dedicated VREFs for a 1-tap DFE. The side effect of a mosaic architecture is the performance of the internal DRAM due to a 1.64× long bus line; however, this is mitigated by a fully-source-synchronous (FSS) bus scheme that is robust to PVT variation. In addition, to reduce the power consumption of the long bus line a low-level swing (LLS) scheme is used in low frequency mode. Furthermore, to enhance power efficiency and yield an adaptive-body-bias (ABB) scheme is introduced in a 3rd generation of a 10nm DRAM process.",

To reduce power consumption of residue amplifier, previous works [2], [4], [5] have explored power efficient residue amplifier architecture, such as dynamic amplifiers (DAs), open-loop amplifiers (OAs) and ring amplifiers (RAs). However, inter-stage gain error of power-efficient DAs, OAs, and RAs needs power-consuming gain calibration to compensate process, power supply, and temperature (PVT) variations.",

      "abstract":"Partial differential equations (PDEs) are ubiquitous in physics and engineering and used for understanding various physical phenomena, including heat, diffusion, fluid and electrodynamics, and quantum mechanics. Analytical PDE solutions are rare, and hence, we approximate using numerical methods. The finite difference method (FDM) approximates PDEs by computing finite differences between discretized solutions. Since finite differences approximate the derivatives of PDEs, many iterations of high-precision computations are required to achieve higher accuracy in their numerical solutions. Hence, computationally-expensive FDM necessitates the use of high-performance computers. As such, their energy consumption is excessive (e.g. 15mJ per iteration and >320J in total for solving PDE with a 128x128 grid using GPU [1]). Consequently, there is an ever-increasing need for a dedicated hardware accelerator for solving PDEs.",

To support this demand, higher density NAND is required: with a smaller cell size and higher interface speed. Generally, scaling down NAND technology requires addressing several common issues: 1) As the number of WL stack layers increases, the cell-string current is reduced due to the increased resistance in a cell string, 2) Deterioration of cell-to-cell interference, due to the reduction of cell pitch, 3) Support of higher IO bandwidth for faster data transfer speed [1]. Another challenge of this work was to minimize the die size because the peripheral circuit area is comparable to that of the cell array. Hence, we integrated the peripheral circuits below the cell array as introduced in [2]. Also, to cope with lower metal-contact height, a novel structure for the capacitor device was used to maximize capacitance per unit area.",

      "abstract":"In order to be able to handle a wide range of AI applications, such as for speech, image, language and autonomous driving, it is necessary that an AI accelerator be flexible enough to handle diversified workloads. Baidu Kunlun, an AI chip designed in-house by Baidu, achieves this capability with high programmability, flexibility and performance. Baidu Kunlun was inspired by the XPU architecture [1]. The chip is implemented in Samsung 14nm process technology. Its peak performance is 230TOPS@INT8 at 900MHz and up to 281TOPS@INT8 at 1.1GHz boost frequency. The memory bandwidth is 512GB/s and the peak power is 160W. Baidu Kunlun achieves good performance across various types of workloads. With 900MHz base frequency, the latencies of BERT, ResNet50, YOLOv3 are 1.7x, 1.2x and 2x less than an Nvidia T4 GPU, respectively, with optimizations from TensorRT. Recently, Baidu Kunlun has been deployed in data centers in Baidu to serve many applications. It achieves 1.5-to-3x better performance for several models within the search engine vs. the Nvidia T4.",

      "abstract":"One of the fastest growing markets in the semiconductor industry is being driven by businesses in the solid-state imaging sector. An overview of the world-wide CIS (CMOS Image Sensor) market is illustrated in Figure 1.4.1. The actual CAGR (compound annual growth rate) from 2010 until 2019 was 15.2% in units and 16.9% in sales, while the forecasted CAGR from 2019 until 2024F is 11.5% in units and 7.2% in sales. Existing DRAM fabrication facilities are being converted into CIS manufacturing plants to cope with the increasing demand for CMOS image sensors [1]. Despite a small 4% drop in revenue, and nearly flat unit growth due to the disruptions caused by COVID-19 in 2020, in 2024F the CIS sector expects a record high of $26.1B and 11B units/year [2]. A simple calculation shows that over the course of 2020 (6.3B units, $18.2B), globally 200 image sensors are being produced every second at an average price of $2.9. Realizing this scale of production by the end of 2020 will require a total of 5.4M wafers (300mm diameter), which is equivalent to a silicon area of 76 soccer fields!",

      "abstract":"While deep neural networks have become an indispensable tool in today's smart devices, their usage is also criticized due to lack of explainability, inability to include domain knowledge, and a need for large volumes of training data. To overcome this, researchers are increasingly using probabilistic models as a part of the system [1] [2] [3] (Fig. 9.4.1). For example, Stelzner et al. [2] complements neural networks with probabilistic models for efficient unsupervised scene understanding robust to noise. Zheng et al. [3] uses a probabilistic model for end-to-end semantic environment mapping during robotic navigation. While sampling techniques are usually used for approximate inference with probabilistic models, fast exact inference is often tractable by using Sum-Product Networks (SPN, also called probabilistic circuits) [4]. This SPN-based inference is preferred over sampling techniques because it provides deterministic results, avoids error-accumulation, and can enable inference in discrete probabilistic programs.",

      "abstract":"Automatic speech recognition (ASR) using deep learning is essential for user interfaces on IoT devices. However, previously published ASR chips [4-7] do not consider realistic operating conditions, which are typically noisy and may include more than one speaker. Furthermore, several of these works have implemented only small-vocabulary tasks, such as keyword-spotting (KWS), where context-blind deep neural network (DNN) algorithms are adequate. However, for large-vocabulary tasks (e.g., >100k words), the more complex bidirectional RNNs with an attention mechanism [1] provide context learning in long sequences, which improve ASR accuracy by up to 62% on the 200kwords LibriSpeech dataset, compared to a simpler unidirectional RNN (Fig. 9.8.1). Attention-based networks emphasize the most relevant parts of the source sequence during each decoding time step. In doing so, the encoder sequence is treated as a soft-addressable memory whose positions are weighted based on the state of the decoder RNN. Bidirectional RNNs learn past and future temporal information by concatenating forward and backward time steps.",

      "abstract":"The proliferation of hyperscale data centers, as well as edge and 5G infrastructure build-outs, requires SerDes running at different rates, over different insertion losses, and in different environments. This work presents a scalable ADC/DSP-based transceiver architecture that runs from 1.25Gb/s NRZ to 56Gb/s PAM-4 in 16nm, supporting channels from very short reach (VSR) at 10dB to long reach (LR) above 35dB. A follow-on design supports 1.25Gb/s NRZ to 112Gb/s PAM-4 in 7nm, and its measured results are also presented in this paper. Some of the key architectural features and innovations that will be described in the paper are: a single decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) with minimum mean square error (MMSE) criteria to drive all feedback control loops, including (i) decision-directed MMSE (DD-MMSE) clock and data recovery (CDR), (ii) feed-forward equalization/decision-feedback equalization (FFE/DFE) bit-error rate (BER) optimization, and (iii) time-interleaved ADC (TI-ADC) clock skew correction.",
