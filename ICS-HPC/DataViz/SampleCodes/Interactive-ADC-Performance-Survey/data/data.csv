Compared to other multi-stage ADC architectures, folding and interpolating ADCs are based on non-linear analog pre-processing. This architecture is an attractive solution for high-resolution ADCs, as extremely linear circuit topologies are not required. To increase the resolution of folding and interpolating ADCs above the published 8 b examples, without raising the number of parallel input stages or the number of comparators in the fine-comparator, a cascaded folding and interpolating architecture is introduced. The ADC achieves 64 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and 75 dB spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR), while quantizing a 15 MHz full-scale input signal at 50 MSample/s.

A straight flash-architecture would need 1023 accurate fast comparators. With a 2 V input range, a comparator offset voltage of no more than 1 mV can be tolerated. Taking into account that the 1 mV is a 3-6 sigma value, leads to a large chip. If, however, the signals to the comparator are amplified before the critical decision, simple small comparators would suffice. To cope with the dynamic offset caused by the clocking and latch action of the comparator itself, the architecture must tolerate comparator offsets of up to 60-80 mV. Hence, a gain of at least 30 is necessary. A single amplifier however, could not handle this, as the input range of 2 V would be amplified to 60 V.

Digitization of IF processing confers several important advantages, including greater reliability, potentially lower power consumption, and improved performance as technology scales. Unfortunately, as analog signal processing is eliminated and the A/D conversion is moved away from baseband, the signal that must be digitized has a larger dynamic range, and the converter must operate at a higher sampling rate. This work introduces a two-path, switched-capacitor architecture for a bandpass ?? modulator that is suited to digitizing narrowband radio signals with large dynamic range. A fourth-order bandpass modulator is implemented in a standard 0.6 ?m, single-poly, triple-metal CMOS process.

This allows the ADC to be moved closer to the receiver front end. Moving the digital interface closer to the antenna reduces receiver analog circuit complexity, eliminates DC-offset cancellation, inphase/quadrature (I/Q) gain calibration, dual I/Q mixers and improves system robustness as mixing is in the digital domain.

This is extended to the quadrature, or complex, case if a complex filter - having complex-valued coefficients and thus not restricted to a symmetrical frequency response - is placed in a ?? loop. The modulator performs a complex A/D conversion on the pair of analog inputs, that are in phase-quadrature, and it has two high-speed bit stream outputs: one represents the real output; the other the imaginary output. When combined, these outputs form a complex signal that accurately represents the complex input within a narrow frequency band. This quadrature modulator is useful in architectures for a single-chip digital-radio receiver. The receiver ideally has no image response, and thus the bulky narrow-band image-rejection filter in the RF stage of a single-path receiver can be replaced with a broadband one. The architecture alleviates many problems of the direct-conversion receiver, often considered for single-chip implementations, since the input signal is mixed to a non-zero IF where 1/f noise and DC offsets cause no problem and self-interference is not an issue because oscillator frequency is offset from the carrier frequency.

A loss in dynamic range occurs if stabilization of the feedback loop for a higher-order DSM uses a 1b feedback signal. The classical 1b ADC and/or DAC do not follow the theoretical SNR of (8+6 N)L(dB), where N is the order of the DSM, and 2L is the oversampling ratio. In contrast, multi-bit feedback stabilizes a higher-order DSM with little loss of dynamic range. As the internal signal swing is reduced with increase in number of feedback signal bits, the multi-bit DSM requires a lower slew rate and thus less power for analog circuits than the 1b case. There is an increase in SNR due to use of a multi-bit internal DAC to reduce the oversampling ratio and hence to reduce power consumption of the analog portion ","Yasuda, A.; Tanimoto, H.; Lida, T.",,,,,,,,30.06140704,1584.893192,0.669364343,184.7623762

The switched op amp (SO) technique allows design of switched-capacitor (SC) circuits at very low supply voltage without the use of multithreshold technologies or voltage multipliers to drive the switches. The basic idea of it is to leave out the switches connected to the output of the amplifier in a SC integrator, because those are the ones that fail to conduct when the supply voltage is low. Switches can only be connected to well-chosen reference voltages. In this implementation the differential modified SO integrator cell is used, so the reference voltages are VSS and VDD.

With a fully differential 1.5 b/stage architecture, the D/A subconverters can in principle be inherently linear, and the main limitation stems from the interstage gain accuracy. Besides the error caused by finite-op-amp gain and capacitor mismatch, the linear portion of the incomplete op-amp settling can also be modeled as an interstage gain error. One way to compensate for interstage gain errors is to adjust the reference voltage from each stage to the next so that the ratio of the reference in one stage to the corresponding value in the previous stage is equal to 1+&epsi;, where &epsi; is the gain error between the stages.

They also offer higher-frequency performance than SC modulators as no critical opamp settling is required. CT modulators with low OSR have achieved a DR greater than 75 dB in a 20 MHz band. However, they all suffer from inaccurate active filtering as filter time constants are set by RC and C/Gm values that vary by as much as plusmn20 to 30%.

Inaccurate NTF zero either degrades the DR or makes the modulator unstable. This work presents an exact time-constant auto-tuning method using an LMS algorithm. With a binary pulse dither injected into the loop at the input of the quantizer, the filter time constant can be calibrated continuously with crystal accuracy until the correlated residual pulse dither disappears in the digital output.","Y-S.

An extra phase is needed, but, surprisingly, there is no speed penalty when compared to a high-gain opamp solution because CLS does not require full settling during the next-to-last phase. In fact, the increased signal swing means that the same SNR can be achieved using smaller sampling capacitors. Thus, it could be argued that CLS can provide accurate results at a higher speed than using a traditional 2-phase operation with a high-gain opamp. For example, with CLS, the performance is maintained over the whole 0.9V supply, whereas a standard configuration has only a 0.6V swing. Thus, the standard configuration requires 2.25x larger sampling capacitors to achieve the same signal to kT/C noise ratio.","B. Gregoire, U-K. Moon",,,,,,,,,,,

Time-Interleaved (Tl) successive-approximation-register-based (SAR) ADCs are ideally suited to these applications due to their highly scalable architecture and due to the steady improvement in matching and density of metal-finger capacitors (MFC). This paper presents a Tl C-2C SAR ADC that achieves high performance by using: (1) a small-area C-2C SAR architecture with low input capacitance; (2) high-speed boosted switches to overcome high device threshold; (3) background comparator offset calibration and radix calibration; and (4) redundant-ADC-based gain, offset and timing calibration to reduce Tl errors.","Erkan Alpman, Hasnain Lakdawala, L.

The limitation of the classical folding architecture is the separate coarse channel to determine which fold an input signal is in. Higher-resolution ADCs benefit from a higher order of folding, which results in more closely spaced folds and makes the alignment between this ""fine"" channel and the ""coarse"" channel increasingly difficult due to offset and settling mismatch. In this paper we eliminate this separate coarse channel using instead a single ""unified"" set of cascaded folding stages, in which each folding stage acts as the coarse channel for the following folding stage. This extends previous work where the coarse channel is distributed and where the cascaded folding stages are pipelined. Our approach is demonstrated in a dual 1.8 V 1.0 GS/s 10 b ADC that achieves plusmn0.2 LSB DNL and 9.1 ENOB at Nyquist while consuming 1.2 W/channel.","R. C. Taft, P. A. Francese, M. R. Tursi, O.

The most promising topologies reported thus far are those that substitute the opamp, which is the largest consumer of power in pipelined ADCs, with alternative and more power-efficient circuits. However, opamp-less pipelined ADCs thus far either: 1) require complex nonlinear calibration, 2) are single- ended, 3) are pseudo-differential, or 4) require a sampling scheme that limits linearity (less than 8b ENOB). In this paper, a low-power pipelined ADC is presented that has significantly lower power consumption than many previous 10b ADCs in the mid-to-high speed range. The ADC does not require power-hungry opamps, and hence achieves similar power savings. However, unlike prior opamp-free topologies, the ADC: 1) requires only stage-gain digital calibration, 2) uses fully differential pipelined stages, and 3) uses a sampling scheme that can achieve high linearity (SFDR of 66dB and better than 9b ENOB).","Imran Ahmed, Jan Mulder, David A.

In this paper, we introduce an ADC architecture based on pulse position modulation (PPM), which relies more on time resolution than on amplitude resolution. In PPM a continuous-time comparator compares the input signal with a voltage ramp. The time interval between the ramp starting point, which is synchronous with the reference clock, and the instant the input signal crosses the ramp is measured by a 2-step time-to-digital converter. Assuming the ramp slope is constant, we can calculate the input-signal amplitude from the measured time vector.","Shahrzad Naraghi, Matthew Courcy, Michael P. Flynn",,,,,,,,,,,

ADC with VCO-Based Integrator and Quantizer,"In this paper we demonstrate a new technique that eliminates the impact of Kv nonlinearity by preserving the integral relationship of the VCO output phase to the input signal. Leveraging the VCO output phase directly precludes the need to span the entire nonlinear Kv characteristic since small perturbations (in the range of 10s of mV) at the tuning node are sufficient to shift the VCO phase by a substantial amount. Since an open-loop VCO is sensitive to frequency offsets and drift, and easily saturates its phase detector for large input signals, some form of negative feedback is necessary. Here, a multibit DAC subtracts the previously quantized phase value from the VCO input, creating a residue that is integrated during the next clock cycle. This feedback loop not only allows large signals to drive the VCO without incurring distortion from Kv nonlinearity, but also it is a 1s,-order CT DeltaSigma ADC loop, and it therefore 1s,-order shapes quantization noise.

ADC Based on a Multi-Bit Time-Domain Quantizer and Feedback Element,"Low-power, small-area, 20 MHz-BW ADCs that can be integrated in nanoscale CMOS technologies are of immense interest to the wireless communication industry. Implementation of high-performance analog circuits in nanometric technologies faces several challenges. Time-domain digital signal processing (TDSP) can be used as an alternative for some analog circuits to overcome these challenges. The TDSP technique utilizes the high timing resolution available in nanoscale technologies, and can be implemented using digital circuits that are inherently less susceptible to noise. Circuits using this technique also become faster, smaller and consume less power with technology scaling. Hence, solutions using TDSP with as many digital circuits as possible are desired. An ADC architecture that uses a VCO-based time-domain quantizer is presented. This architecture uses a conventional feedback element (multi-element DAC with DEM) and 950 MHz sample rate that leads to high power consumption. In this work, a pulse-width modulator (PWM) and an all- digital time-to-digital converter (TDC) are used to implement the quantizer as well as the feedback element in the time domain. This approach achieves the necessary linearity in the feedback path without DEM or calibration, and allows a low output rate of 250 MS/S.","Vijay Dhanasekaran, Manisha Gambhir, Mohamed M.

Operating in discrete time also allows for system reconfiguration by changing the sampling frequency. Moreover, different sampling frequencies can be applied throughout a system. This multirate feature can then be exploited to trade performance for power and flexibility. The multirate technique can also be of benefit to discrete-time DeltaSigma modulators. In DeltaSigma modulators, the first integrators are the largest contributors to the overall power consumption since they set the overall noise and distortion of the modulator. The multirate technique can then be used to reduce the sampling speed of the first integrators and hence the power and compensate for loss in resolution by increasing the speed of the last integrators. However, multirate processing inside a single-loop DeltaSigma modulator introduces additional complexity due to the feedback from the last integrators to the input operating at a lower sampling frequency. This complexity can be avoided by using a cascaded architecture in which the sampling frequency is modified between the stages. It can be shown that a cascade DeltaSigma with the first loop operating at fs/2 and the second loop at 2fs is equivalent in terms of resolution to a cascade DeltaSigma with both loops operating at fs. Furthermore, a cascaded implementation can offer a power-efficient implementation in a multimode context by switching off the appropriate last stages . In this paper we present a 90 nm CMOStri-mode DT multirate cascade DeltaSigma modulator.","Lynn Bos, Gerd Vandersteen, Julien Ryckaert, Pieter Rombouts, Yves Rolain, Geert Van der Plas",,,,,,,,,,,
