Continuing to scale compute performance will require the creation and effective use of new specialized compute engines, and will require the participation of application experts to be successful. If we play our cards right, and develop the tools that allow our customers to become part of the design process, we will create a new wave of innovative and efficient computing devices.",

        "abstract": "With the dramatically increasing use of mobile and portable devices, the need for computation has intensified, motivating the transformation of traditional static services (Web and storage) to evolve toward distributed Web services, forming Cloud 1.0; in this process, the evolution into the Smart Device Era involved many changes: stationary computing devices are going mobile, standalone devices are becoming connected, and peer-to-peer communication (email) extending to many-to-many (social networking). Two of the biggest enablers for Cloud 1.0 have been clients such as Smartphones and tablets, connected through wired and wireless networks. Embedded within each of these clients are the CPU and GPU processors needed to enable consumer applications and mobile human-interface devices (HIDs). To satisfy the ever-growing computational requirements, mobile CPU clock frequencies have extended into the GHz region. To avoid this barrier, mobile clients are driving the downscaling of process technology while motivating the rapid rise of multi-core CPUs and GPUs. In this process, new architectures involving asymmetric-CPU and octa-cores are emerging. As well, investment is pouring into the hardware/software (HW/SW) infrastructure to provide adaptive power management, thermal throttling, and efficient heterogeneous multiprocessing, all to enable maximum core usage and energy efficiency within the tight thermal limits of the Smartphone and tablet domains.",

        "abstract": "Scientific knowledge is the basis for new technology, but in return, new technology enables progress in science. One example has been the introduction of semiconductor imagers in astronomy. Telescopes now can go into space, taking stunning pictures and opening up new wavelength windows. Another example will be described in this paper. In the field of elementary particle physics, the experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN use custom-designed CMOS chips as key components for the analog signal processing and digital information extraction, and these chips enabled significant discoveries to be made, that of the Higgs particle in particular, after only a few years of operation.",

The rapid pace of innovation and trends in consumerization have made these experiences affordable and widely available, greatly increasing end users' expectations. In the years ahead, networks will undergo the greatest architectural transition seen in the past two decades, with the advent of software-defined networking (SDN) and the Internet of things (IoT). By taking an experience-driven approach to this architectural shift, we can understand the requirements for the underlying compute and network infrastructure, client devices, and sensors and the interaction of applications with the network. This paper discusses the next generation of networked experiences.",

In order to meet new standards, such a OIF CEI-25G-LR, CEI-28G-MR/SR/VSR, IEEE802.3bj and 32G-FC, data-rates are increased to 25 to 28Gb/s, which is more than 75% higher than the previous generation of SerDes. For SerDes applications with several hundreds of lanes integrated in single chip, power consumption is very important factor while maintaining high performance. There are several previous works at 28Gb/s or higher data-rate [1-2]. They use an unrolled DFE to meet the critical timing margin, but the unrolled DFE structure increases the number of DFE slicers, increasing the overall power and die area. In order to tackle these challenges, we introduce several circuits and architectural techniques. The analog front-end (AFE) uses a single-stage architecture and a compact on-chip passive inductor in the transimpedance amplifier (TIA), providing 15dB boost. The boost is adaptive and its adaptation loop is decoupled from the decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) adaptation loop by the use of a group-delay adaptation (GDA) algorithm. DFE has a half-rate 1-tap unrolled structure with 2 total error latches for power and area reduction. A two-stage sense-amplifier-based slicer achieves a sensitivity of 15mV and DFE timing closure. We also develop a high-speed clock buffer that uses a new active-inductor circuit. This active-inductor circuit has the capability to control output-common-mode voltage to optimize circuit operating points.",

        "abstract": "Network traffic speeds are increasing to meet the demands of data centers and network operators to support data-rich services like video streaming and social media. This has accelerated the adoption of 100Gb/s connectivity from the present 10Gb/s and 40Gb/s rates. One challenge that remains is the high power consumption of 100Gb/s systems. As mentioned in [1], power dissipation of the 100GbE gearbox transceiver is a significant portion of the optical module power. This paper demonstrates a low-power quad-lane 20-to-28Gb/s transceiver targeting 100GbE/40GbE (IEEE 802.3ba) standard. The transceiver features a low-jitter TX, half-rate calibrated RX slicer with folded active inductor and a wide-range PLL (20 to 28GHz) with low-power half-rate clock driver using programmable distributed inductors. It operates from a standard 0.9V supply and the power consumption for line-side transceiver is 780mW for 28Gb/s. Additionally the chipset integrates a system interface that is CAUI-compliant, composed of a 10-lane data bus operating at 9.95 to 11.2Gb/s. In default mode it converts 100GbE (10\u00d710 Gb/s) signal to a 4\u00d725Gb/s line signal and vice versa. The line-side interface can also be reconfigured as 40GbE, with both line- and system-side operating at 4\u00d711.2Gb/s.",

Prominent among the power-hungry receiver building blocks are the clock-and-data-recovery circuit, the deserializer, and the front-end equalizer. The use of charge-steering techniques has shown promise for the low-power implementation of the first two functions [1]. This paper introduces a half-rate 25Gb/s equalizer employing charge steering and achieving an efficiency of 0.232mW/Gb/s.",

To achieve this goal, the following innovations are introduced: 1) fast and energy-efficient charge-based latch and sample-and-hold (S/H) topologies; 2) a CMOS-clocked quarter-rate DFE architecture with summer gain and power optimization; 3) an integrating summer with a compact common-mode restoration circuit. Leveraging these techniques, the DFE is capable of operating at or below 0.7V, with an energy efficiency of or better than 0.25pJ/bit.",

        "abstract": "Point-to-point data transmission with clock-embedded signaling (CES) has been generally adopted in intra-panel interfaces, which need to support fine resolution, high frame rate, and large display size. Since CES embeds the clock-transition information in the data stream, it enables wide-range clock acquisition with PLL-based [1,2] or DLL-based [3-5] clock-and-data recovery (CDR) schemes. It also offers additional benefits of reduced EMI and low cost by eliminating the need for an additional clock channel or reference signal. For clock recovery, however, CES transmits a significant number of extra bits attached to each data packet to carry clock transition information. The number of extra bits is at least three [4] or four [3], sufficient to reduce the effect of inter-symbol interference (ISI) on clock transitions from adjacent random data patterns, providing cleaner reference to the clock recovery circuit. The repeated transitions in every data packet also intensify the spectral energy at the clock frequency as the data-rate increases, seriously aggravating EMI problem. This paper presents a DLL-based CDR with a new CES scheme that carries clock transitions with only one bit overhead but effectively sees the same ISI as a three- or four-bit overhead. By introducing a pattern-dependent clock embedding, our CES assimilates with random data transitions and almost eliminates the EMI issue. The CDR, implemented in 65nm CMOS, shows a lock range of 6.5 to 9Gb/s and a power efficiency of 0.63mW/Gb/s at 9Gb/s.",

Recently, massively parallel links such as on-chip links [1-3], silicon interposers [4,5], or wide I/Os [6] are gaining popularity to meet increasing demand for data transmission with a limited power budget. However, calibration overhead for thousands I/Os to compensate coefficient errors due to nano-scale variation has a high hardware cost. To reduce this overhead, we develop a coefficient-error-robust FFE (B-FFE) TX architecture that uses the channel loss to suppress eye perturbation due to coefficient errors while behaving identically to a conventional FFE.",

        "abstract": "High-speed transceivers embedded inside FPGAs require software-programmable clocking circuits to cover a wide range of data rates across different channels [1]. These transceivers use high-frequency PLLs with LC oscillators to satisfy stringent jitter requirements at increasing data rates. However, the large area of these oscillators limits the number of independent LC-based clocking sources and reduces the flexibility offered by the FPGA. A ring-based PLL occupies smaller area but produces higher jitter. With injection-locking (IL) techniques [2-3], ring-based oscillators achieve comparable performance with their LC counterparts [4-5] at frequencies below 10GHz. Moreover, addition of a PLL to an injection-locked VCO (IL-PLL) provides injection-timing calibration and frequency tracking against PVT [3,5]. Nevertheless, applying injection-locking techniques to high-speed ring oscillators in deep submicron CMOS processes, with high flicker-noise corner frequencies at tens of MHz, poses a design challenge for low-jitter operation. Shown in Fig. 2.8.1, injection locking can be modeled as a single-pole feedback system that achieves 20dB/dec of in-band noise shaping against intrinsic VCO phase noise over a wide bandwidth [6]. As a consequence, this technique suppresses the 1/f2 noise of the VCO but not its 1/f3 noise. Note that the conventional IL-PLL is capable of shaping the VCO in-band noise at 40dB/dec [6]; however, its noise shaping is limited by the narrow PLL bandwidth due to significant attenuation of the loop gain by injection locking. To achieve wideband 2nd-order noise shaping in 20nm ring oscillators, we present a circuit technique that applies pulse-position-modulated (PPM) injection through feedback control.",

        "abstract": "The bandwidth of a phased-locked loop (PLL) is dependent on several analog parameters that are subject to process, temperature and voltage spreads, as well as to variations along the frequency-tuning range. Even in digital PLLs, which rely on a digital loop filter, the bandwidth still depends on the gains of two mixed-signal building blocks, namely the time/digital converter (TDC) and the digitally-controlled oscillator (DCO), that have conversion characteristics that are not well-controlled. The situation is even more cumbersome employing a singlebit TDC, often referred to as bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), where the linearized gain is inversely proportional to the input jitter [1]. An accurate and repeatable value of the PLL bandwidth, and in the general of the frequency response, is essential to meet several specifications, such as stability margin, settling time, jitter and spur level. When the PLL is operated as a direct frequency modulator with pre-emphasis of the modulation signal, the accuracy requirement of the frequency response is even more demanding [2]. Previously disclosed methods to control PLL bandwidth require a modulation signal to be injected into the loop [2], compensate the gain variations of just a single block (e.g., VCO [3] or BBPD [4]), or operate in the foreground [5]. This paper presents a digital PLL employing a digital background normalization of loop gain, which makes it independent of any analog variable (except for the reference frequency, which often is available from an accurate source). This method requires no injection of additional test signals and operates at a low rate, achieving low-noise and low-power operation, and also is suitable even for bangbang PLLs.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the demand for low cost and system-on-a-chip for mobile terminals has led to the development of a highly-integrated, low-distortion, and high-power-efficiency CMOS power amplifier (PA). To improve the power efficiency of the conventional linear PA [1-4], an envelope tracking (ET) technique, which modulates supply voltage of a linear PA, has attracted attention. However, the published power efficiency, gain and output power are not sufficient for LTE applications [5], and its typical implementation requires an external supply modulator that is a high-speed power supply circuit [6]. Envelope elimination and restoration (EER) is an alternative supply modulation technique that can further improve the power efficiency over ET by replacing the linear PA with a switching PA driven by a phase signal [7]. However, to meet the specified low distortion, especially for LTE with a wide bandwidth baseband signal, an EER PA generally has difficulty achieving a wide bandwidth for the phase signal path, and requires a high-speed supply modulator, and highly accurate timing between envelope and phase signals. To overcome these problems, this paper introduces an envelope / phase generator based on a mixer and a timing aligner based on a delay-locked loop. Additionally, they were integrated with a switching PA and a supply modulator on the same die.",

        "abstract": "To optimize the power consumption and system performance of battery-supplied devices, it is required to monitor and adjust the transmitted RF power accurately and continuously. This is typically done by an external power detector (PD), which increases area and cost. On the other hand, fully integrated power detectors are typically voltage-based [1-5] and only give the correct RF output power for a fixed load impedance. But in practice, antenna impedance variations will occur, causing VSWR mismatches that introduce an error in these voltage-based RF output power measurements. This paper presents a 5GHz WLAN PA with an on-chip true-RMS Power Detector, without any additional power loss or area overhead. The power detector is based on a magnetically coupled sense winding and takes advantage of transformer-based power combining and impedance transformation that has become common practice in nanometer CMOS RF PAs. The proposed power detector performs both an RF voltage and RF current measurement at the PA output and is therefore capable of performing a True power measurement, even under VSWR mismatches or load variations. This proposed power detector is implemented in 40nm standard CMOS and unlike earlier reported power detectors [1-4], it is integrated together with a 5GHz RF PA targeting the WLAN (IEEE 802.11a) communication standard.",

        "abstract": "Modern high-data-rate communication systems such as LTE use spectrally efficient modulation schemes with a high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), placing stringent linearity demands on the RF power amplifiers (PA). The main challenge for LTE power amplifiers is therefore to achieve high efficiency and high linearity for a wide power range. In addition, delivering Watt-level output power is another challenge for CMOS RF power amplifiers due to the low breakdown voltage of the transistors. Series-combining transformers (SCT) enable high output power levels by summing up the output voltages of low-voltage CMOS power amplifiers [1-4].",

A receiver with programmable phase shift and high linearity is crucial to cope with interference. Switched-capacitor vector modulators can provide adequate phase shift and linearity [3,4], but so far, at the cost of a high power consumption. As power consumption increases linearly with the number of antenna elements, it is one of the bottlenecks hindering commercialization of beamforming. In this paper, we demonstrate several design techniques on architectural and circuit levels, to reduce the power consumption per element, while still achieving competitive Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR).",

However, like most wideband passive-mixer-based designs, the architecture is far less tolerant of harmonic blockers, that is blockers located at or around precise integer multiples of the LO frequency. In a typical M-phase passive mixer, shown in Fig. 3.6.1a, most out-of-band blockers are heavily attenuated by large shunt capacitors at the inputs of the baseband TIAs. Harmonic blockers are an exception and do not experience this attenuation since they are downconverted inside the TIA bandwidth, are amplified along with the wanted signal, and are only rejected by the subsequent harmonic-rejection circuitry. Since TIA gain is generally large in order to maintain a low noise figure, moderate harmonic blockers will saturate the TIAs and consequently the receiver.",

In terms of harmonic rejection, even though the state-of-the-art work reports over 60dB rejections on the 3rd- and 5th- order harmonics with a single mixer [1], higher-than-5th-order harmonic rejections are still required for the low-band channels in TV tuners and thereby RF filters are indispensable at the RF front-end. However, due to the difficulties of integrating RF filters satisfying low noise and high linearity over wide bandwidth, the previous works inevitably had to use external inductors [2-4]. Although a recent work successfully integrates an RF filter satisfying all the stringent specifications by current-domain signal flow from the LNA output to the baseband stage [5], the transconductance stage at the filter input is not linear enough to drive the high-power input and thus the input signal needs to be attenuated at the RF front-end, which eventually degrades system SNR.",

        "abstract": "Since the invention of radio, superheterodyne has been the architecture of choice for receivers (RX). Thanks to its high intermediate-frequency (IF), the problems related to flicker noise, time-varying dc offsets, in-band LO leakage and sensitivity to 2nd-order intermodulation are simply avoided. Unfortunately, the high IF requires high-quality-factor (Q) band-pass filters for image rejection, which cannot be easily integrated in CMOS. This forced the CMOS receivers to migrate to zero (or low) IF and suffer from the abovementioned problems. Recently, there have been attempts to revisit the high IF operation by exploiting N-path filtering [1] and a combination of a discrete-time (DT) band-pass charge-sharing filtering with feedback filtering [2]. Here, we propose a superheterodyne RX architecture with full DT operation using only gm stages, switches and capacitors. The transfer function is accurate and controlled by the clock frequency and precise capacitor ratios.",

        "abstract": "The latest passive-mixer-first wideband receiver (RX) [1] has managed to squeeze the power (10 to 12mW) via resonant multi-phase LO and current-reuse harmonic rejection BB, but the removals of RF gain and virtual ground severely penalize its NF (10.5\u00b12.5dB), while devaluing its original IIP3 benefits (+10dBm). The described wideband RX exploits an RF-to-BB current-reuse topology, with parallel N-path active/passive mixers, to leverage such power-performance tradeoffs. Specifically, the RX features: 1) a current-reuse RF front-end with an N-path active mixer to realize most RF-to-BB functions in the current domain, resulting in better power efficiency and linearity; 2) a feedforward N-path passive mixer to enable LO-defined input matching with zero external components, while offering frequency-translated band-pass filtering and noise cancelling; 3) a single-MOS pole-zero LPF to perform current-mode BB filtering while alleviating the tradeoff between the in-/out-of-band linearity, and 4) a BB-only two-stage harmonic-recombination (HR) amplifier to boost the 3rd and 5th harmonic rejection ratios (HRR3,5) with low hardware intricacy. Targeting the TV-band (0.15 to 0.85GHz) cognitive radios for IEEE 802.22/802.11af, the RX manifests favorable NF (4.6\u00b10.9dB) and out-of-band IIP2/IIP3 (+61/+17.4dBm) under low power dissipation (10.6 to 16.2mW).",

        "abstract": "Multiphase DC-DC converters are essential to provide good efficiency over a wide range of load current, especially for today's multicore SoCs, which usually have a wide range of current profile. Active-phase-count (APC) control, as proposed in [1-3], is the key technique that offers the wide load range, and dynamically adjusts the number of phases according to load conditions. However, an APC transition induces a voltage disturbance due to current redistribution among phases. This makes the APC control only suitable for a voltage regulator with large output capacitors beyond 1000\u03bcF, or with high switching frequency beyond 10MHz [4] that hardly delivers more than 2A current with a good efficiency. To mitigate the disturbance impact, [2] has proposed adding or dropping a phase slowly, to allow the PID control to gradually redistribute the phase currents. However, the load current may change direction spontaneously before the completion of the transition, leading to deterioration in the transient response. This paper presents a fast APC scheme which performs the transition within 1 switching cycle, and only requires 66\u03bcF capacitors to limit the voltage ripple within 10mV, an 88% ripple reduction with respect to the optimal PID-only control. The proposed APC scheme utilizes digital phase current data, which is also needed to determine the optimal phase count [1-3]. However, the A/D conversions consume 3mW, which is 28% of the total power consumption. A continuous-time/discrete-time (CT/DT) hybrid current control architecture is introduced to eliminate the 3mW penalty while producing A/D converted data by time sharing of the analog circuitry in the control loop. Moreover, a fast transient response configuration is designed, offering less than 40mV fluctuation during an 8A load transition and less than 5mV fluctuation during a 2V line transition.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, the clock frequency, the number of cores, and the power dissipation of application processors (APs) for portable electronics have dramatically increased. As a result, peak processor currents have reached several amperes with slew rates on the order of 1A/ns. These fast large steps incur large output voltage (VOUT) droops, which induce failed paths and cause processor black-outs. Present voltage regulators (VRs) combat these challenges by using bulky output capacitor (COUT) arrays that could add up to over 100\u03bcF. However, this practice is untenable for next-generation APs, which have severely limited PCB area and require fast dynamic voltage scaling. These challenges have led to great demand for ultra-fast VRs. PWM control requires a bandwidth 5 to 10\u00d7 less than the switching frequency, fSW, which results in a slow response [1]. Hysteretic control has been proposed to achieve faster response [2, 3], however, it still suffers from an inherent delay (tdelay) up to the discharge period, (1-D)T, due to realistic hysteretic window size and inductor current (IL) slew limit. Consider, for example, a fast hysteretic VR achieving 10% voltage droop for an instant load step of 5A. For an inductor (L) chosen to have IL ripple <; 200mA, and COUT under a few \u03bcF, tdelay cannot exceed a few ns. This requires a fSW from 0.5 to 1GHz, which in turn causes a large switching loss and restricts the feasible power level of the converter. This is against the power demand trend of APs. An interleaved multiphase topology can be the most effective way to improve both the system response and the equivalent IL slew rate by changing the number of phases; however, clock and phase synchronization and current sharing for conventional hysteretic control are challenging.",

        "abstract": "Improving battery longevity in portable devices usually requires the use of different voltage levels with a wide range of load capability for various functional blocks. Since a single-inductor-multiple-output (SIMO) converter can support multiple output voltages while using only one inductor, it is an excellent candidate to minimize the component count and thus the production cost. However, the cross-regulation and power consumption are two main issues of the previously reported SIMO converters [1-5]. Although pseudo-continuous conduction-mode (PCCM) control with a freewheel period [1] tries to augment power density and eliminate cross-regulation, associated power dissipation of freewheel switch exacerbates its overall efficiency. The charge-control technique with energy recovery presented [2] decouples the output channels between each switching cycle, at the expense of additional switching loss and slow response. The comparator-based controlled SIMO converters are investigated in [3, 4] and the cross-regulation in most channels is improved due to the fast response of the comparator. However, since the channel that is last connected to inductor is inevitably regulated by the accumulative error of all channels to balance the overall inductor current, every load transition at other outputs will introduce serious cross-regulation [3] and load-regulation problem [4] in the channel. In addition, cross-regulation and slow response also limit the application of dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) technique, which is widely used in single-output converters to improve the system power efficiency by providing variable voltage with fast reference tracking.",

        "abstract": "Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is an effective strategy in reducing the power consumption of a processor through adjusting its supply voltage at runtime. The power converter that drives the processor should have a wide output voltage range and fast reference-tracking response while maintaining a high efficiency. For such applications, inductive switching converters are suitable candidates [1-4]. To enhance the transient response and to reduce the size of off-chip components, DC-DC converters switching in the 10MHz range are studied recently. When switching at a high frequency, efficiency is compromised as the switching loss becomes significant. Moreover, comparator delay of a few ns causes serious over-charging and over-discharging of the ramp capacitor and the delay also limits the maximum duty cycle of the converter. A current-mode control needs an on-chip current sensor that would consume too much power when running in the 10MHz range. In [5], a 5MHz converter employs auto-selectable peak- and valley-current control, but the duty cycle range is limited to 0.6. A higher switching frequency (fs) would further reduce this range and would not be applicable for DVS. Therefore, a voltage-mode control with Type-III compensation for loop bandwidth extension becomes an attractive solution. However, a conventional Type-III compensator needs large on-chip compensation capacitors and resistors. In [6], a pseudo Type-III compensator reduces the value and thus size of those components, however, it requires adding lowpass and bandpass functions that complicates the design, and furthermore it does not use any special technique for fast reference tracking.",

Figure 4.5.2 shows the power train of the 2-phase ReSC converter. The architecture is similar to the 2:1 SC converters in [2-3], but uses inductance, LX, to resonate with the on-chip flying capacitor, CX. On-chip bypass capacitance, Cbp, is used to filter the output voltage and complete the resonant loop in the energy transfer process. The timing of key signals in converter operation is shown in Fig. 4.5.3. In normal operation at the fundamental resonant frequency, \u03c9o=(LXCX)-1/2, resonant impedance ZX is configured in parallel with Vin-Vout in \u03c61; in \u03c62, ZX is configured in parallel with Vout. If there is a voltage difference between Vin-Vout and Vout-GND, voltage VX appears as a square wave at the resonant frequency. In \u03c61, a positive half wave current flows into ZX, drawing energy from Vin; in \u03c62, a negative half wave current flows out of ZX, supplying energy to the load. Similar to the SC topology, this process can be modeled as an effective resistance, REFF, the details of which are discussed in [6]. Operation at the fundamental mode provides the lowest achievable REFF, which is approximately RESR\u00b7\u03c02/8 for the 2:1 configuration, near the minimum achievable REFF for a comparable SC converter.",

        "abstract": "The growing demand for both performance and battery life in portable consumer electronics requires SoCs and power management circuits to be small, efficient, and dynamically powerful. Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) can help achieve these goals in load circuits, though generally at the expense of increased DC-DC converter size (through use of external inductors) or loss (through linear regulation). While switched-capacitor (SC) DC-DC converters can offer conversion in small fully integrated form factors [1-5], their efficiencies are only high at discrete ratios between the input and output voltages. To increase an SC converter efficiency across its output voltage range, multiple conversion ratios can be utilized to realize a finer output voltage resolution. For instance, many converters employ a small handful of conversion ratios [1-4]. However, more conversion ratios are generally necessary to achieve high efficiency across the wide output range necessary for DVS, as converter efficiencies can otherwise fall by more than 20% between unloaded ratios [1-4]. Unfortunately, increasing the number of ratios beyond a small handful using standard topologies can significantly increase the number of components, escalating converter complexity and adding losses in the additional switching elements. To overcome this, a successive approximation (SAR) SC topology was proposed in [6] which cascades several 2:1 SC stages to provide a large number of conversion ratios with minimal hardware overhead. However, the linear cascading of stages introduces cascaded losses, limiting overall efficiency. For example, the minimum Rout is more than 30X Rout of a similar ratio Series-Parallel topology using the same silicon area. Additionally, current density is limited to that of a single stage, and capacitance utilization can be low for many conversion ratios.",

The total volume of the PCB components consisting of the chip in wafer-level chip-scale package (WLSCP) and 4 external SMD capacitors (1 input, 1 output and 2 floating) is only 1.1mm3 making it attractive for space-constrained mobile applications. The volume is more than 15\u00d7 smaller compared to competitive inductive converters [1-3]. The maximum thickness of the solution is 550\u03bcm.",

        "abstract": "Integrated voltage regulator modules (iVRMs) [1] provide a cost-effective path to realizing per-core dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), which can be used to optimize the performance of a power-constrained multi-core processor. This paper presents an iVRM system developed for the POWER8\u2122 microprocessor, which functions as a very fast, accurate low-dropout regulator (LDO), with 90.5% peak power efficiency (only 3.1% worse than an ideal LDO). At low output voltages, efficiency is reduced but still sufficient to realize beneficial energy savings with DVFS. Each iVRM features a bypass mode so that some of the cores can be operated at maximum performance with no regulator loss. With the iVRM area including the input decoupling capacitance (DCAP) (but not the output DCAP inherent to the cores), the iVRMs achieve a power density of 34.5W/mm2, which exceeds that of inductor-based or SC converters by at least 3.4\u00d7 [2].",

        "abstract": "A resonant-clock design for the IBM POWER8 processor core was implemented with 2 resonant modes (and a non-resonant mode), saving clock power over a wide frequency range from 2.5GHz to more than 5GHz. The POWER8 microprocessor is composed of 12 chiplets, each containing a single resonant clock grid for one core and its L2 cache, and a half-frequency, non-resonant clock grid for the L3 cache. The clock grids drive the local clock buffers (LCBs) that in turn drive the latches. The LCBs are gated off to measure the global clock power from the PLL to the LCBs. The resonant core communicates synchronously with the L3, requiring low skew between the domains. The chip was designed in a 22nm SOI process, including two ultra-thick-metal (UTM) layers (3 microns thick) for power distribution, I/O, all long global clock wires, and the resonant clock inductors. The UTM technology reduces wire resistance and simplifies inductor design, but requires accurate transmission line modeling and special routing.",

The system interface includes two on-chip memory controllers, each with two memory channels and supports multiple system topologies. The processor has 4.31B transistors in a high-\u03ba metal-gate tri-gate 22nm CMOS technology with 9 metal layers [2]. The design supports a wide array of product offerings with thermal design power ranging from 40 to 150W and frequencies ranging from 1.4 to 3.8GHz. Fig. 5.4.1(a) shows the processor block diagram. The floorplan (Fig. 5.4.1(b)) is driven by the ring bus routability and latency, as well as the chop requirements to smaller core counts. The cores and associated L3 cache are organized in columns of five, with the ring bus segment embedded. The fully populated die has 15-cores in three columns. The 10-core chop removes the rightmost 3rd column and its dedicated top and bottom IOs. CMOS muxes embedded in the ring bus are programmably operable in a 2-or-3-columns configuration. The 6-core chop removes the 2nd and 4th rows from the 10-core die.",

These supply fluctuations are caused by sudden changes in the current consumed by the microprocessor in response to variations in workloads. This non-ideal supply can cause performance degradation or functional failures. Therefore, a significant amount of margin (10-15%) needs to be added to the ideal voltage (if there were no AC voltage variations) to ensure that the processor always executes correctly at the committed voltage-frequency points. This excess voltage wastes power proportional to the square of the voltage increase.",

        "abstract": "The demand for high-performance graphics capability even in extremely power-constrained platforms such as smartphones and tablets requires circuit techniques that scale from efficient operation at low voltage to high performance when needed. It is well known that energy efficiency improves as supply voltage is scaled down, reaching a maximum near the device threshold voltage where switching energy savings from voltage reduction is balanced by increased leakage energy from frequency loss. Achieving this voltage reduction, however, requires techniques that address intrinsic VMIN limitations in arrays (SRAM, register file arrays, ROMs), voltage droop guardband reduction in logic, as well as techniques for reducing leakage energy, which can dominate at low voltage. It is important that these techniques, while providing energy-efficient operation at low voltage, do not impact the high-performance mode, which is also critical for graphics workloads.",

The Potenza processor module (PMD) is an integrated design unit, comprising two identical cores sharing a 256KB L2 cache, and is designed to be scalable for different server configurations. Each PMD contains 84 million transistors, occupying over 14.8mm2, and averages 4.5W under representative workloads. The initial platform is configured with 4 PMDs, a shared 8MB L3 cache, and 4 DRAM channels arranged around a central switch. Potenza can operate up to 3GHz at 0.9V supply and is fabricated in a 40nm bulk CMOS technology using 10 metal layers (Fig. 5.8.7).",

        "abstract": "The 4th Generation Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 processor, codenamed Haswell, is a family of products implemented on Intel 22nm Tri-gate process technology [1]. The primary goals for the Haswell program are platform integration and low power to enable smaller form factors. Haswell incorporates several building blocks, including: platform controller hubs (PCHs), memory, CPU, graphics and media processing engines, thus creating a portfolio of product segments from fan-less Ultrabooks\u2122 to high-performance desktop, as shown in Fig. 5.9.1. It also integrates a number of new technologies: a fully integrated voltage regulator (VR) consolidating 5 platform VRs down to 1, on-die eDRAM cache for improved graphics performance, lower-power states, optimized IO interfaces, an Intel AVX2 instruction set that supports floating-point multiply-add (FMA), and 256b SIMD integer achieving 2\u00d7 the number of floating-point and integer operations over its predecessor. The 22nm process is optimized for Haswell and includes 11 metal layers (2 additional metal layers vs. Ivy Bridge [2]), high-density metal-insulator-metal (MIM) capacitors, and is tuned for different leakage/speed targets based on the market segment. For example, in some low-power products, the process is optimized to reduce leakage by 75% at Vmin, while paying only 12% intrinsic device degradation at the high-voltage corner.",

        "abstract": "The future penetration of long-term-evolution mobile phone services and various data cloud services will continuously accelerate the present traffic evolution. Figure 6.2.1 shows the commercial system capacity evolution of NTT's network over the last 30 years. The transmission capacity of today's Optical Transport Network (OTN) exceeds 1Tbit/s based on the conventional single-core singlemode fiber (SMF) at the growth rate about 1.4-to-1.5 times a year. In 10 years however, we will encounter the fundamental capacity limit of conventional SMF at around 100 Tb/s due to optical fiber nonlinearity and the limitation of allowable fiber launched power into the SMF. In this paper, the impact and future scaling of digital signal processing (DSP) on high-capacity OTN are investigated. A high-speed optical communication system with coherent detection aided by DSP ASIC, that is a digital coherent system, has great potential to change the transmission system design. This approach can enhance total commercial system capacity to more than 8 Tbit/s. Digital coherent systems will evolve to both high-speed applications and ultralow power consumption applications in the near future. Further future enhancements to the key DSP are discussed enabling 1Pb/s/fiber capacity in combination with space division multiplexing.",

        "abstract": "Data converters are required to interface digital processing engines, for example FPGAs, to the real world. Data conversion is typically accomplished using discrete devices that are interfaced to the FPGA using various IO standards. However, exponential growth in bandwidth as a result of increasing channel count and higher sample rate means this IO interface is becoming a limiting factor in the system budget with respect to interconnect complexity and associated power. The integration of flexible data converters with FPGA eliminates this IO cost and also offers a dynamically scalable, power efficient platform solution that addresses diverse application needs. In this paper, we demonstrate an aggregate bandwidth in excess of 400Gb/s using sixteen 16b DAC instances running at 1.6GS/s with an FPGA-to-die interface power of 0.3mW/Gb/s. We introduce a reconfigurable receive system that allows channel count to trade with system sample rate. Specifically, we demonstrate a 500MS/s ADC by interleaving four 125MS/s units.",

        "abstract": "According to the trend towards high-resolution CMOS image sensors, pixel sizes are continuously shrinking, towards and below 1.0\u03bcm, and sizes are now reaching a technological limit to meet required SNR performance [1-2]. SNR at low-light conditions, which is a key performance metric, is determined by the sensitivity and crosstalk in pixels. To improve sensitivity, pixel technology has migrated from frontside illumination (FSI) to backside illumiation (BSI) as pixel size shrinks down. In BSI technology, it is very difficult to further increase the sensitivity in a pixel of near-1.0\u03bcm size because there are no structural obstacles for incident light from micro-lens to photodiode. Therefore the only way to improve low-light SNR is to reduce crosstalk, which makes the non-diagonal elements of the color-correction matrix (CCM) close to zero and thus reduces color noise [3]. The best way to improve crosstalk is to introduce a complete physical isolation between neighboring pixels, e.g., using deep-trench isolation (DTI). So far, a few attempts using DTI have been made to suppress silicon crosstalk. A backside DTI in as small as 1.12\u03bcm-pixel, which is formed in the BSI process, is reported in [4], but it is just an intermediate step in the DTI-related technology because it cannot completely prevent silicon crosstalk, especially for long wavelengths of light. On the other hand, front-side DTIs for FSI pixels [5] and BSI pixels [6] are reported. In [5], however, DTI is present not only along the periphery of each pixel, but also invades into the pixel so that it is inefficient in terms of gathering incident light and providing sufficient amount of photodiode area. In [6], the pixel size is as large as 2.0\u03bcm and it is hard to scale down with this technology for near 1.0\u03bcm pitch because DTI width imposes a critical limit on the sufficient amount of photodiode area for full-well capacity. Thus, a new technological advance is necessary to realize the ideal front DTI in a small size pixel near 1.0\u03bcm.",

        "abstract": "Miniaturized low-power artificial compound eyes in a small form factor and a low payload can be a promising approach to provide wide-field information for micro-air-vehicle (MAV) applications. Recently, research efforts have been made to realize bio-inspired artificial compound eyes to mimic the wide field of view (FoV) of insect visual organs by implementing photoreceptors to independently face different angles [1-2]. However, these approaches have drawbacks. They use complicated fabrication processes to form a hemispherical lens configuration and secure an independent optical path to each photoreceptor. We take a simple and practical approach to realize wide-field optic flow sensing in a pseudo-hemispherical configuration by mounting a number of 2D array optic flow sensors on a flexible PCB module as shown in Figure 7.2.1. In this scheme, the 2D optic flow sensor should meet the requirements of MAV applications: extremely low power consumption while maintaining robust optic flow generation. Conventional optic flow algorithms, such as Lucas-and-Kanade, require huge amounts of numerical calculations; therefore, they require substantial digital hardware (CPU and/or FPGA), resulting in large power consumption [3-4]. As an alternative approach for low-power implementation, bio-inspired elementary motion detector (EMD) based algorithms (or neuromorphic algorithms) have been studied and implemented in analog VLSI circuits for autonomous navigation [5-6]. However, pure analog signal processing is easily susceptible to temperature and process variations and it is difficult to scale the pixel size or apply low-power design techniques because extensive analog processing is implemented in pixel-level circuits. In this work, we have devised and implemented a time-stamp-based optic flow algorithm, which is modified from the conventional EMD algorithm to give an optimum partitioning of hardware blocks in analog and digital domains as well as assign adequate allocation of pixel-level, column-parallel, and chip-level processing. Temporal filtering, which may require huge hardware resources if implemented in the digital domain, remains in a pixel-level analog processing unit. Feature detection is implemented using digital circuits that are column parallel. The embedded digital core decodes the 2D time-stamp information into velocity using chip-level processing. Finally, the estimated 16b optic flow data are compressed and transmitted to the host through a 4-wired Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) bus.",

        "abstract": "A vision chip is a high-speed and compact vision system that integrates an image sensor and parallel image processors on a single silicon die. Nowadays, high-speed vision chips with powerful recognition capabilities are greatly demanded in applications such as: industrial automation, security, entertainment, robotic vision, and human-machine interaction. Some 100-to-1,000fps vision chips have been reported [1-4]. These chips integrate pixel-parallel and row-parallel SIMD array processors to speed up low- and mid-level image processing [1,2]. Recently, microprocessors (MPU) have been embedded to carry out high-level image processing [3,4]. Although excellent in low- and mid-level processing, these systems are poor in high-level feature vector (FV) recognition tasks due to the von Neumann bottleneck of the MPU. As a consequence, these chips can no longer achieve 1,000fps system-level performance, from image acquisition to high-level feature-recognition processing.",

Numerous ToF range imager developments have been reported [1-4]. Recent developments are often based on CMOS image sensor technology with pinned photodiode options [5-7], which are suitable for cost-effective mass production. Reported CMOS ToF range imagers use single-tap or two-tap lock-in pixels; to cancel the influence of background light, two or four sub-frames are used to produce a background-canceled range image. These architectures, however, have difficulty with precise range measurements of moving objects, because background light cancelation is not guaranteed for moving objects. Lock-in pixels without any charge-draining gate suffer from background light during the readout time of the operation. Another important issue with CMOS ToF range imagers for high range resolution is the speed of lock-in pixels, which must be improved to use high-modulation-frequency light or short-duration light pulses.",

        "abstract": "Recently, 3D scanning systems have attracted rapidly rising attention in combination with 3D printers. One of the common technologies in contactless 3D scanners is the light-section method, which has advantages in term of accuracy. The method, however, requires a long base line between a camera and light source to achieve high resolution and a mechanical scanning system. A high range resolution Time-of-Flight (ToF) imager provides new possibilities of implementing a miniature head, which allows flexible scanning of an object with a complicated structure. The range resolution of reported CMOS ToF imagers [1-3] is limited to a few centimeters. For higher resolution, higher modulation frequency is required. However, the modulation frequency used for CMOS ToF imagers is limited to several tens of MHz. This paper presents a ToF imager with 0.3mm range resolution, which corresponds to 2ps time resolution. To achieve this high resolution, the imager uses a ToF measurement technique based on an impulse photocurrent response [4] and draining-only modulation (DOM) pixels [5]. To realize a range imager with 2D pixel array, column-wise gating-clock skew calibration is implemented to demonstrate simultaneous sub-mm ToF measurements for the whole pixel array.",

This paper presents the pixel and 2GS/s signal paths in a state-of-the-art Time-of-Flight (ToF) sensor suitable for use in the latest Kinect sensor for Xbox One. ToF cameras determine the distance to objects by measuring the round trip travel time of an amplitude-modulated light from the source to the target and back to the camera at each pixel. ToF technology provides an accurate high pixel resolution, low motion blur, wide field of view (FoV), high dynamic range depth image as well as an ambient light invariant brightness image (active IR) that meets the highest quality requirements for 3D motion detection.",

        "abstract": "The directly modulated distributed-feedback laser (DML) is widely employed in medium-reach optical links due to its cost effectiveness. However, DMLs are not appropriate for use in fiber links longer than 20km at 6Gb/s or equivalent, because the SNR penalty increases abruptly due to excessive chromatic dispersion caused by frequency chirp. Therefore externally modulated lasers (EMLs), which are more costly, have been a natural choice for applications requiring extended reach. In this paper, a clock and data recovery (CDR) IC that compensates for chromatic dispersion caused by the frequency chirp of the DML is presented. The CDR with EDC is fabricated in a 90nm CMOS process, and the test-chip consumes 226mW at 6Gb/s.",

        "abstract": "High-performance systems require high-bandwidth interconnections. The aggregate bandwidth required between two processors, for example, is expected to extend into the terabit-per-second range or higher. Bandwidth is typically the bottleneck in such situations. Optical interconnect technologies have the potential to overcome bandwidth limitations for such chip-to-chip or board-to-board communication through increased channel speed and/or multiple channels. Channel speeds have reached 25 Gb/s and higher , in addition, a 24-channel transmitter and 24-channel receiver is disclosed that employs optical vias in silicon to couple the lens array. Two possible structures to implement a multichannel system are shown. A conventional multichannel architecture places the laser diode drivers (LDD) and VCSELs on the same side of the interposer. This paper describes a 12\u00d75 two-dimensional optical I/O array for 600 Gb/s, utilizing 60 channels, each with an operating speed of 10Gb/s. The physical limitation in the number of channels is relaxed by connecting the LDDs through vias to the VCSELs placed on the opposite side of the interposer. The arrangement of the RX, in relation to the two-dimensional photo detector (PD) and TIA array, is the same as the TX. Key elements of each channel are the LDD consuming 2.17 mW/Gb/s and the TIA that consumes 0.96 mW/Gb/s while achieving an input-referred noise of 0.95 \u03bcArms. The low power of the LDD and TIA improve the package reliability while the high sensitivity of the TIA enables the transmission via a long optical waveguide.",

        "abstract": "Multi-mode fiber (MMF) is the most cost-effective fiber for high-speed LANs. Modal dispersion leads to optical-energy spreading over several symbol periods, drastically limiting distance and data-rate. Compared with copper channels, equalization is challenging because the channel response varies enormously from fiber to fiber and also over time [1]. These aspects, paired with the practical difficulty of implementing TX pulse shaping, increase the equalization burden at the receiver. To date, electronic dispersion compensation (EDC) consisting of an FIR filter cascaded with a nonlinear equalizer, such as DFE, enables 10Gb/s up to 300m according to the 10GBASE-LRM standard. To satisfy the demand for greater network capacity, solutions to reach 25Gb/s on a single fiber, and up to 400Gb/s aggregated throughput with space-division multiplexing on 16 fibers are being investigated [2]. At this data-rate, robust DSP-based EDCs still need high power, indicating an analog approach to signal processing to reduce power. To have market impact and economic feasibility, the interface must be flexible, accommodating a variable data-rates for compatibility with legacy channels and different standards [2]. In addition, achieving high energy efficiency at each standard (i.e., data rate) is fundamental.",

        "abstract": "Next-generation high-performance computing systems require high-bandwidth serial links to transport high-speed data streams among computational blocks. Optical links have recently attracted attention due to their low channel loss at high frequencies, requiring simpler equalization circuits than electrical links. The energy-efficiency of optical links can thus be significantly improved [1-5]. Broadband techniques such as inductive peaking are commonly used in highspeed optical transceivers for bandwidth enhancement at the expense of the chip area. Inductor-less receivers have been proposed [4,6] to reduce chip area but they usually consume more power or have lower data rates at given technology nodes. In this paper, we present two optical receivers that each consists of a pseudodifferential CMOS push-pull transimpedance amplifier (TIA), a DC offset-cancellation circuit, a limiting amplifier (LA) with interleaving active-feedback [6], and a T-Coil fT-doubler output buffer. The block diagram and experimental setup are shown in Fig. 8.4.1. The capacitance of the off-chip GaAs PIN photodetector (PD), which is wire-bonded to the CMOS receiver, is 100fF with 0.4A/W responsivity. The two optical receivers have identical designs except for the LA, in which two different inductive peaking techniques, conventional and shared-inductor, are designed and fabricated on the same die in 28nm CMOS technology.",

        "abstract": "The IEEE802.3an 10GBASE-T standard describes full-duplex 10Gb/s Ethernet transmission over four pairs of up to 100m UTP cable. For the implementation of high-density 10GBASE-T network switches, highly integrated transceivers are required that have both a small form factor and high power efficiency. This paper describes an analog front-end (AFE) that is used in a quad-port 10GBASE-T transceiver chip. The small form factor of the AFE allows for the use of a 23\u00d723mm2 BGA package, enabling implementation of 48-port switches with all transceivers in a single row on the PCB pitch-matched to the RJ45 connector arrays. The design achieves >62dBc transmitter SFDR, >62dBc echo cancellation (EC) SFDR, and >60dBc receiver SFDR up to 400MHz. It occupies an area of 15.1mm2 per port in a 40nm CMOS process. At 100m full 10Gb/s traffic, the AFE dissipates less than 1.75W.",

        "abstract": "Gigabit Ethernet PHY (GPHY) transceivers find wide use in SoCs and standalone PHY chips with hundreds of millions of ports shipped every year. Transceiver design has recently focused on power reduction driven by the need for higher port density and throughput with minimum energy and thermal cost. The line drivers that deliver power from a high voltage supply to remote 100\u03a9 differential loads dominate the GPHY power consumption. The supply voltage determined by the transmit amplitude specs (e.g., 2Vppdiff for 1000BASE-T/100BASE-TX Ethernet) does not scale with technology. This paper presents an architecture that enables rail-to-rail full-duplex operation for high voltage efficiency resulting in a 2.5V GPHY driver in 28nm CMOS that saves 24% power from the mainstream 3.3V drivers.",

        "abstract": "Continuous-rate clock-and-data recovery (CDR) circuits with automatic frequency acquisition offer flexibility in both optical and electrical communication networks, and minimize cost with a single-chip multi-standard solution. The two major challenges in the design of such a CDR are: (a) extracting the bit-rate from the incoming random data stream, and (b) designing a wide-tuning-range low-noise oscillator. Among all available frequency detectors (FDs), the stochastic divider-based approach has the widest frequency acquisition range and is well suited for sub-rate CDRs [1]. However, its accuracy strongly depends on input transition density (0 \u2264 \u03c1 \u2264 1), with any deviation of \u03c1 from 0.5 (50% transition density) causing 2\u00d7(\u03c1-0.5)\u00d7106 ppm of frequency error. In this paper, we present an automatic frequency-acquisition scheme that has unlimited range and is immune to variations in transition density. Implemented using a conventional bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), it requires minimum additional hardware and is applicable to sub-rate CDRs as well. Instead of using multiple LC oscillators that are carefully designed to cover a wide frequency range [2,3], a ring-oscillator-based fractional-N PLL is used as a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) to achieve both wide range and low noise, and to decouple the tradeoff between jitter transfer (JTRAN) bandwidth and ring-oscillator-noise suppression.",

        "abstract": "As an alternative to the conventional dual-loop architecture, reference-less CDR architectures have become more popular in industry because of their simplicity and flexibility [1-5]. However, the robustness of the transition between frequency acquisition and phase locking is always a concern, particularly for the linear CDR, which has an extremely limited capture range. Many works, based mainly on the Pottbacker frequency detector (FD) [1], have been reported. In [3] the capture range of the FD is only \u00b12.4% at 20Gb/s with no capacitor bank in the VCO; in [4] the capture range of the FD is about \u00b16.4% at 2.75Gb/s, with an 8b resolution of the capacitor bank in the VCO; in [5] the capture range is \u00b115% at 10Gb/s, with an 11b resolution of the capacitor bank. Thus the Pottbacker FD inherently suffers from a limited capture range, requiring a dedicated FD and a stringent tradeoff between the CDR capture range and the number of VCO bands. In the presence of input jitter and phase-detector (PD) non-idealities, it is difficult to design an architecture where the resolution of the capacitor bank and the turnoff mechanism can guarantee that the VCO frequency will eventually fall within the pull-in range of the CDR.",

        "abstract": "High-speed and high-density interconnections between racks and modules in the high-performance computing systems and data centers are currently being developed. The transmission range of conventional electrical interconnections is limited due to the bandwidth of electrical channels. VCSEL-based optical interconnection technologies are a promising solution for overcoming bandwidth bottlenecks in large scale computing systems [1-3]. Although it is anticipated that the next challenge for optical interconnections is to move to a serial data-rate of 40Gb/s, there are few 40Gb/s class VCSELs at present. Overdriving is a method that boosts high-frequency response to overcome the VCSEL speed limit [4,5]. To develop high-density optical interconnections, a low-power over-driving IC is a key technology. In addition, the optical modulation amplitude (OMA) must be increased to enable long-distance transmission in large scale computing systems as a data center. To achieve this large modulation amplitude, we must overcome the jitter issue caused by the intrinsic group delay of VCSELs. In this paper, we present a 40Gb/s driver IC for over-driving a 25Gb/s VCSEL using a new 2-tap pre-emphasis circuit with tunable group-delay compensation. This circuit compensates for the complex group delay of VCSELs. With this circuit, we achieve 40Gb/s low-jitter operation with 2.3dBm OMA and reduce the power consumption to as low as 312mW/ch.",

        "abstract": "The popularity of the Near-Field Communication (NFC) system stems from being able to establish communication by merely being in the vicinity of another NFC device, an operation known as \u201ctap and go\u201d. An NFC device is quite complex: it has to support both ASK/BPSK modulation, variable data rates from 106kb/s to 848kb/s, different ASK modulation indices (8% to 100%), different card types (NFC-A/B/F), and various coding. It also has different operating modes such as Proximity-Inductively-Coupled Card (PICC) or card-emulation mode, Proximity-Coupled-Device (PCD) or reader mode and Peer-to-Peer (P2P) mode. Furthermore, some PCDs transmit NFC-A/B/F ASK data in a polling loop manner. Therefore, PICC receivers must support joint data-type detection for successful communication with such PCDs. The device shown in Fig. 9.1.1 supports all these operating modes and complies with ISO-14443, ISO-18092 and NFC Forum standards. The SoC has an ultra-low current receiver, a digital transmitter with a 250mA-maximum-current-drive Class-D PA, a Single-Wire Protocol (SWP) supporting two external UICC SIM cards and one micro-SD chip, an energy-harvesting rectifier unit, an agile synthesizer, and a digital modem. Traditionally, two separate receivers with respective synthesizers and clock recovery/generation circuits are adopted for PICC, PCD and P2P modes [1,2]. In addition, three parallel analog demodulators are needed (one each for NFC-A, B and F) to support joint data-type detection, thus increasing die area significantly. The focus of this paper is the adoption of a single receiver with one reconfigurable PLL to support all NFC modes for compact die area.",

For wireless medical applications, lossless connection and noninvasive transmission are important factors. Moreover, in medical imaging applications such as 4D ultrasound imaging, high-information-rate transmission with a real-time display are demanded. To support the high-definition video format, a data-rate as high as 500Mb/s is desirable for raw data transmission. The mm-Wave transceiver [1] or the MB-OFDM transceiver [2] can provide high data-rate, but high power consumption and high transmission power are shortcomings for medical applications.",

        "abstract": "Future binaural hearing-aid devices face severe energy constraints on the wireless links where the ear-to-ear link enables signal processing of sound for both ears to enhance speech intelligence and the ear-to-device link provides an audio channel to commercial electronics such as smart TVs, MP3 players, and smart phones. Due to the limited size of the battery (35 to 90mAh) especially for in-the-ear (ITE) and in-the-canal (ITC) types, a sub-mW transceiver is required for long operational time. A low-data-rate impulse-radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) transceiver [1] achieves low power consumption with aggressive duty-cycled operation, namely 1%, but suffers from the bit-level synchronization problem by the baseband. Moreover, the low-data-rate IR-UWB exhibits a high peak transmission power to maintain a sufficient average transmission power for the given link margin. The constant-envelope frequency-modulated ultra-wideband (FM-UWB) system in [2,3] features a low peak voltage and a steep roll-off spectrum, but the lack of duty-cycled operation makes it difficult to achieve low power. Narrowband WBAN transceivers such as the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) transceiver [4,5] offer good compliance with existing wireless SoCs, but the sub-mW power consumption is not feasible and they have a potential coexistence problem with existing Bluetooth devices. In this paper, a chirp-FSK-based UWB transceiver is proposed to significantly reduce the peak transmission power with relaxed duty-cycled operation for noninvasive, energy-efficient, and agile short-range communications.",

        "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things has urged the development of ultra-low-power (ULP) radios at the lowest possible cost, while being universal for worldwide markets. Both current-reuse [1,2] and ultra-low-voltage [3] receivers are promising solutions. [1] unifies most RF-to-BB functions in one cell for current-mode signal processing, resulting in a high IIP3 (-6dBm) at small power (2.7mW) and area (0.3mm2). However, outside the current-reuse cell, another supply is required for other circuits, complicating the power management [1,2]. [3] facilitates single-0.3V operation of the entire receiver at 1.6mW for energy harvesting, but the limited voltage headroom and transistor fT call for bulky inductors/transformers to assist the biasing and to tune out the parasitics, penalizing the IIP3 (-21.5dBm) and area (2.5mm2). In both cases, a fixed LC network was adopted for input matching and pre-gain to lower the NF, which is costly and inflexible for multi-band designs.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an ultra-low-power (ULP) 2.4GHz RX for short-range wireless personal and body-area networks. In such applications, the RF transceiver consumes up to 90% of the total battery energy in a remote sensor node. In order to extend the operation lifetime, it is a primary design goal for such transceivers to improve the energy efficiency, expressed as power consumption/data-rate, to below 1nJ/bit. Although energy-detection or superregenerative ASK RXs [1] are very efficient, they are vulnerable to interference and this leads to a poor quality of the wireless link in a crowded 2.4GHz ISM band. On the other hand, FSK/PSK-type modulations are popular in the target applications because of their power-efficient hardware and higher immunity to interference. They are also widely adopted in many short-range wireless standards like IEEE802.15.4 and Bluetooth Smart. Thanks to the constant-envelope nature of FSK/PSK-type modulations, e.g., HS-OQPSK, they only modulate data on the carrier frequency or phase, so the TX hardware can be simplified, while the efficiency can be enhanced by driving the circuits into a saturated mode, e.g., PLL-based FSK TXs [2,5]. Similarly, in the RX counterpart, instead of processing the signal in the I/Q domain, it can be demodulated in the phase domain by using a phase-ADC [3]. However, such approach still requires a power-hungry high-frequency multi-phase LO generation and \u201c2-dimensional\u201d downconversion and filtering circuits. In the single-channel RX of [4], the VCO is part of the carrier-recovery and phase-demodulation loop. Therefore, the VCO frequency can be easily \u201cpulled away\u201d by an interferer, and the RX has a poor sensitivity because phase noise is deteriorated by the signal chain when input level is low.",

        "abstract": "The release of the IEEE802.15.6 standard has led to increased interest in low-power technologies for wireless body-area-networks (WBAN). The power dissipation, supply voltage, and IC area are some of the most important criteria for successful WBAN implementations. Analog-intensive heterodyne receivers (RX) have been previously demonstrated, consuming 4 to 5mW of power from a 1-to-1.2V supply while occupying large silicon area, due to the presence of area-intensive analog building blocks such as low-pass filters at the IF [1,2]. Digital-intensive RX architectures can potentially result in sub-1V operation with significant reductions in power consumption and area, but require system and circuit-level innovations to achieve desired sensitivity and linearity. This paper presents a mostly-digital 2.4GHz RX architecture that uses a sub-sampling technique with digital IF/baseband signal processing to enable low-power (1.3mW) and low-voltage (0.6V) operation, resulting in ~3x reduction in power consumption. Early analog-to-digital conversion leads to the IC occupying only 0.35mm2 of active silicon area. While the IC focuses on WBAN demodulation, the presented techniques are applicable to other low-power standards as well.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of the IEEE802.15.6 standard (15.6) for wireless-body-area networks signals the advent of new medical applications, where various wireless nodes in, on or around a human body monitor vital signs. Radio communication often dominates the power consumption in the nodes, thus low-power transceivers are desired. Most state-of-the-art low-power transceivers support only proprietary modes with OOK or FSK modulations, and have poor sensitivity or low data rate [1,2]. In this work, a 15.6-compliant transceiver with enhanced performance is proposed. First, the data-rate is extended to 4.5Mb/s to cover multi-channel EEG applications. Second, while a best-in-class energy efficiency of 0.33nJ/b is achieved in the high-speed mode, a dedicated low-power mode reduces the RX power further in low-data-rate operation. Third, a sensitivity 5 to 10dB better than the 15.6 specification is targeted to accommodate extra path loss due to shadowing effects from human bodies.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-low-power (ULP) transceivers enable short-range networks of autonomous sensor nodes for wireless personal-area-network (WPAN) applications. RF PLLs for frequency synthesis and modulation consume a significant share of the total transceiver power, making sub-mW PLLs key to realize ULP WPAN radios. Compared to analog PLLs [1], all-digital PLLs (ADPLLs) are preferred in nanoscale CMOS as they offer benefits of smaller area, programmability, capability of extensive self-calibrations, and easy portability [2]. However, analog PLLs dominate the field of ULP WPAN radios [1], since the time-to-digital-converter (TDC) of an ADPLL has traditionally been power hungry. We present a 2.1-to-2.7GHz 860\u03bcW fractional-N ADPLL in 40nm CMOS for WPAN applications, which breaks the 1mW barrier and consumes at least 5\u00d7 lower power compared to state-of-the-art ADPLLs.",

        "abstract": "The worldwide demand for high-performance mobile or car infotainment application processors (AP) is increasing. This demand coexists with the need for low power to achieve long battery life and avoid thermal runaway. A heterogeneous CPU configuration is an effective solution. The proposed heterogeneous quad/octa-core AP has a combination of high-performance 2GHz cores and energy-efficient 1GHz cores. The maximum performance in the octa-core configuration is 35600 DMIPS. The key design highlights are: 1) Using a dedicated PLL and H-tree clock in the high-performance CPU achieves both 2GHz operation and reduced dynamic power. 2) A low-leakage SRAM in a 28nm HPM process is used and the leakage current of the peripheral circuits of the SRAM macro is optimized via multiple threshold voltages (Vt) and gate lengths (Lg). 3) The effects of process and voltage variations are accurately corrected by an on-chip process sensor and direct sensing of the voltage in the power mesh of the chip. 4) An enhanced CPU clock control mechanism is employed, which uses an on-chip delay sensor to reduce AC IR drop. 5) The heterogeneous CPU architecture maintains high performance even during thermal throttling.",

        "abstract": "Augmented reality (AR) is being investigated in advanced displays for the augmentation of images in a real-world environment. Wearable systems, such as head-mounted display (HMD) systems, have attempted to support real-time AR as a next generation UI/UX [1-2], but have failed, due to their limited computing power. In a prior work, a chip with limited AR functionality was reported that could perform AR with the help of markers placed in the environment (usually 1D or 2D bar codes) [3]. However, for a seamless visual experience, 3D objects should be rendered directly on the natural video image without any markers. Unlike marker-based AR, markerless AR requires natural feature extraction, general object recognition, 3D reconstruction, and camera-pose estimation to be performed in parallel. For instance, markerless AR for a VGA input-test video consumes ~1.3W power at 0.2fps throughput, with TI's OMAP4430, which exceeds power limits for wearable devices. Consequently, there is a need for a high-performance energy-efficient markerless AR processor to realize a real-time AR system, especially for HMD applications.",

        "abstract": "Recently there has been increased demand for not only ultra-low power, but also high performance, even in standby-power-critical applications. Sensor nodes, for example, need a microcontroller unit (MCU) that has the ability to process signals and compress data immediately. A previously reported 130nm CMOS and FeRAM-based MCU features zero-standby power and fast wakeup operation by incorporating FeRAM devices into logic circuits [1]. The 8MHz speed, however, was not sufficiently high to meet application requirements, and the FeRAM process also has drawbacks: low compatibility with standard CMOS, and write endurance limitations. A spintronics-based nonvolatile integrated circuit is a promising option to achieve zero standby power and high-speed operation, along with compatibility with CMOS processes. In this work, we demonstrate a fully nonvolatile 16b MCU using 90nm standard CMOS and three-terminal SpinRAM technology. It achieves 20MHz, 145\u03bcW/MHz operation with a 1V supply in the active state, and 4.5\u03bcW intermittent operation with 120ns wakeup time and 0.1% active ratio, without forwarding of re-boot code from memory. The features provide sufficiently long battery life to achieve maintenance-free sensor nodes.",

In recent years, a multitude of wireless standards has been proposed to meet differing requirements of individual application domains such as data rates, range, QoS, peak and average power consumption. From a commercial perspective, a single radio component that is capable of supporting multiple wireless standards \u2014 targeting multiple application domains/markets \u2014 while reducing integration costs is highly preferable. At the same time, the multi-standard support may not compromise low-power operation or silicon area.",

        "abstract": "Modern mobile communication systems face conflicting design constraints. On the one hand, the expanding variety of transmission modes calls for highly flexible solutions supporting the ever-growing number and diversity of application requirements. On the other hand, stringent power restrictions (e.g., at femto base stations and terminals) must be considered, while satisfying the demanding performance requirements. In order to cope with these issues, existing SDR platforms, e.g. [1-2], propose an MPSoC with a heterogeneous array of processing elements (PEs). MPSoC solutions provide programmability and parallelism yielding flexibility, processing performance and power efficiency. To schedule the resources and to apply power gating, a static approach is employed. In contrast, we present a heterogeneous MPSoC platform (Tomahawk2) with runtime scheduling and fine-grained hierarchical power management. This solution can fully adapt to the dynamically varying workload and semi-deterministic behavior in modern concurrent wireless applications. The proposed dynamic scheduler (CoreManager, CM) can be implemented either in software on a general-purpose processor or on a dedicated application-specific hardware unit. It is evident that the software approach offers the highest degree of flexibility; however, it may become a performance-bottleneck for complex applications. A high-throughput ASIC was presented in [3], but this solution does not permit scheduling algorithms to be adjusted. In this work, these limitations are overcome by implementing the CM on an ASIP.",

The scattered networks require that the digital baseband for mobile user equipment handle multiple RATs, multiple bands, as well as seamlessly transition between these. In 3GPP release 10 [1] the problem with scattered frequency bands has been addressed by the possibility to aggregate spectrum from two separated carriers to create a wider aggregated total bandwidth. Which carriers to combine depends on the spectrum available to the specific operator.",

        "abstract": "Autonomous wireless sensor nodes for cloud networks require ultra-low-power electronics. In particular, sensor readout interfaces need low-speed high-precision ADCs for capturing, e.g., bio-potential signals, environmental information, or interactive multimedia. For these applications, state-of-the-art SAR ADCs can provide highly power-efficient solutions (<;10fJ/conversion-step) but with limited accuracy (SNDR <;63dB) [1,2]. Alternatively, \u0394\u03a3 ADCs offer higher precision at the cost of lower efficiency (e.g. 84dB SNDR with 54fJ/conversion-step [3]). This work bridges the existing performance gap by extending the accuracy of low-power SAR ADCs to SNDRs in the order of 70-to-80dB. Feedback-controlled data-driven noise reduction [1], oversampling, chopping [4] and dithering [5] techniques are combined to increase both SNR and linearity in a power-efficient way. Various ADC modes are supported by making these techniques individually programmable, thereby extending the application range.",

        "abstract": "Analog-to-digital converters (ADC) are extensively used in wireless sensor networks and healthcare electronic devices to monitor long-term signal conditions. It is essential to prolong battery life in these applications by using an energy-efficient ADC. A successive-approximation register (SAR) architecture, mostly composed of digital circuits, can achieve low power under low supply voltages [1,2]. Power consumption can be decreased by using either an energy-efficient capacitive-DAC switching method [1] or a low-power comparator with a majority voting technique [2]. In this work, a small coarse ADC resolves the MSB bits. Then, a detect-and-skip algorithm and an aligned switching technique are used to reduce the big fine DAC switching energy. The comparator power is also decreased by utilizing a low-power comparator during coarse conversion and a low-noise comparator during fine conversion. As a result, its FoM performance is as low as 0.85fJ/conversion-step, which is about 3 times better than that of the state-of-the-art work [2].",

This design targets the same high speed and resolution while simultaneously achieving power efficiency previously associated only with low-speed, low-resolution ADCs. Furthermore, the power reported includes the consumption from the active reference generator, clock generator and encoder (since this is an industrial SoC), differentiating it from the majority of reported SAR ADCs. A dynamic residue amplifier with excellent noise-filtering properties, embedded in a pipelined architecture, is a key power-saving technique. In addition, an energy-efficient switched-capacitor (SC) DAC is obtained by using a small fraction of the total DAC capacitance during the initial SAR steps. The realized Walden FOM is 9.1fJ/conv-step while the Schreier FoM is 172.3dB, currently the highest reported number to date for sampling speeds greater than 0.1Ms/s, based on the extensive list of recent data converters compiled in [3].",

In addition, it is difficult to design low-voltage OTAs in modern, scaled CMOS. The ring amplifier [1-4] provides an intriguing alternative to traditional OTAs. This work improves the power efficiency and practicality of the ring amplifier by introducing a self-biasing scheme and by eliminating the comparators.",

Recently, achieving the highest levels of linearity with ultra-low power consumption has proven to be extremely challenging using modern CMOS technology with limited headroom. While zero-crossing-based circuits (ZCBC) have proven to be a power-efficient alternative to opamps in pipeline ADCs, performance using zero-crossing techniques have to-date only been demonstrated with ENOB \u226411. This paper presents a 15b 48MS/s zero-crossing-based pipeline ADC that achieves low power consumption of 99fJ/step and high linearity performance of 73.1dB SNDR and >80dB SFDR at Nyquist, demonstrating state-of-the-art FoM for thermal-noise-limited designs of 165.1dB.",

        "abstract": "Advanced wireless cellular infrastructure systems require DACs with high spectral purity over a wide bandwidth and which are fit for integration of multiple transmit channels with DSP. This calls for IM3 linearity better than -80dBc up to high frequencies and low power dissipation. In this paper, a high-speed current-steering DAC is reported that combines low power and high linearity, enabled by a 3-dimensional sort-and-combine (3D-SC) calibration technique, CML switch-driving circuitry, and switch cascoding. It achieves similar linearity at significantly reduced power compared to a state-of-the-art high-linearity DAC [1] while its IM3 performance is more than 10dB better than the multi-GS/s low-power DAC in [2]. The 16b 3.2GS/s DAC is implemented in a 65nm CMOS process and achieves -80dBc IM3 up to 600MHz while dissipating 240mW from 1.2V and 3.3V supplies.",

        "abstract": "Optical 3D imagers for gesture recognition suffer from large size and high power consumption. Their performance depends on ambient illumination and they generally cannot operate in sunlight. These factors have prevented widespread adoption of gesture interfaces in energy- and volume-limited environments such as tablets and smartphones. Wearable mobile devices, too small to incorporate a touchscreen more than a few fingers wide, would benefit from a small, low-power gestural interface. Gesture recognition using sound is an attractive alternative to overcome these difficulties due to the potential for chip-scale size, low power consumption, and ambient light insensitivity. Using pulse-echo time-of-flight, MEMS ultrasonic rangers work over distances of up to a meter and achieve sub-mm ranging accuracy [1,2]. Using a 2-dimensional array of transducers, objects can be localized in 3 dimensions. This paper presents an ultrasonic 3D gesture-recognition system that uses a custom transducer chip and an ASIC to sense the location of targets such as hands. The system block diagram is shown in Fig. 12.1.1. Targets are localized using pulse-echo time-of-flight methods. Each of the 10 transceiver channels interfaces with a MEMS transducer, and each includes a transmitter and a readout circuit. Echoes from off-axis targets arrive with different phase shifts for each element in the array. The off-chip digital beamformer realigns the signal phase to maximize the SNR and determine target location.",

        "abstract": "Capacitive touch screens have enabled compelling interfaces for displays. Three-dimensional (3D) sensing, where user gestures can also be sensed in the out-of-plane dimension to distances of 20 to 30cm, represents new interfacing possibilities that could substantially enrich user experience. The challenge is achieving sensitivity at these distances when sensing the small capacitive perturbations caused by user interaction with sensing electrodes. Among capacitive-sensing approaches, self capacitance enables substantially greater distance than mutual capacitance (i.e., between electrodes), but can suffer from ghost effects during multi-touch. For gesture recognition, however, processing via classifiers can overcome such effects, enabling a rich dictionary of gestures. Nonetheless, the sensing distance of such systems has been too limited for 3D sensing.",

        "abstract": "Realization of a mutual-capacitance touch-sensing system spanning over 30 inches is not a straightforward task, because the SNRs of conventional sequential drive controllers degrade as the number of sensor channels increases. One common way to overcome this drawback is to increase the driving voltage, which however results in an increase in system complexity and cost because it requires high-voltage circuits and devices. This SNR issue is resolved by driving the sensor channels in parallel [1,4] as shown in Fig. 12.3.1. Although the parallel drive mixes up the signals from the multiple channels driven at the same time, the original signals can be reconstructed from the sequence of mixed signals if the drive sequences are linearly independent from each other. By appropriately designing the parallel drive sequences, the SNR is enhanced by \u221aM times compared to that of the sequential drive [1], where M is the number of drive channels. An analog front-end (AFE) IC capable of driving and sensing a 143\u00d781 mutual-capacitance sensor is developed in 0.18\u03bcm 1P5M CMOS. A 32-inch and a 70-inch touch system are realized with the use of the AFE and an SNR over 37dB for 1mm diameter stylus is attained in either system.",

Multiple touch points are detected by a two-step dual-mode capacitance scan, where self- and mutual-capacitance measurements are hierarchically performed in two steps to reduce scan time that is otherwise increased due to high resolution. 160 dedicated row and column ADCs are used for the parallel read-out to further reduce scan time. A time-domain digital conversion that uses a counter-based slope ADC significantly reduces power and area for the parallel ADC approach. The signal attenuation due to the sensor capacitance reduction in the 1mm fine-pitch electrode is compensated by using thorough noise-reduction techniques in the sensor analog front-end (AFE). A 0.35\u03bcm CMOS prototype demonstrates 41dB SNR with >3\u00d7 higher pitch resolution, >10\u00d7 faster touch-point scan, 12\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 higher energy and area efficiency compared to state-of-the-art touch sensors [1,2].",

At the same time, there are many circuit and system design challenges to achieving high functionality in such ultra-low-power microsystems. One of the key sensing modalities in these systems is capacitive sensing. With zero static current during signal readout, capacitive sensing is well suited to ultra-low-power microsystems and has been widely adopted in the sensing of pressure [2,3], displacement [4], and humidity [5].",

        "abstract": "This paper describes an all-CMOS temperature sensor intended for RFID applications that achieves both sub-1V operation and high accuracy (\u00b10.4\u00b0C) over a wide temperature range (-40 to 125\u00b0C). It is also an ultra-low-power design: drawing 700nA from a 0.85V supply. This is achieved by the use of dynamic threshold MOSTs (DTMOSTs) as temperature-sensing devices, which are then read out by an inverter-based 2nd-order zoom ADC. Circuit errors are mitigated by the use of dynamic error-correction techniques, while DTMOST spread is reduced by a single room temperature (RT) trim. The latter feature constitutes a significant advance over previous all-CMOS designs [5,6], which require two-point trimming to approach the same level of accuracy.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a precision BJT-based temperature sensor implemented in standard CMOS. Its interface electronics consists of a continuous-time duty-cycle modulator [1], whose output can be easily interfaced to a microcontroller, rather than the discrete-time \u0394\u03a3 modulators of most previous work [2-4]. This approach leads to high resolution (3mK in a 2.2ms measurement time) and high energy efficiency, as expressed by a resolution FoM of 3.6pJK2, which is a 3\u00d7 improvement on the state of the art [4,5]. By employing chopping, dynamic element matching and a single room temperature trim, the sensor also achieves a spread of less than \u00b10.15\u00b0C (3\u03c3) from -45 to 130\u00b0C.",

Today's 32kHz quartz resonators and oscillators are facing challenges in size reduction. Previously described MEMS-based oscillators can achieve tight accuracy but operate at high frequency with power unsuitable for mobile applications. This paper introduces a 32kHz MEMS-based oscillator. Based on a comparison table of recent oscillators shown in Fig. 12.9.6, it offers the smallest size, 1.55\u00d70.85mm2, with the best frequency stability, 100ppm (XO) and 3ppm (TCXO) over the industrial temperature range of -40 to 85\u00b0C. Supply current is 0.9 and 1.0\u03bcA for XO and TCXO, respectively, at supply voltages from 1.5 to 3.6V.",

        "abstract": "CMOS technology scaling continues to drive higher levels of integration in VLSI design, which adds more compute engines on a die. To meet the overall performance-scaling needs, high-speed and high-bandwidth memory is becoming increasingly important. Conventional VLSI systems often rely on on-die SRAMs to address the performance gap between CPU and main memory, DRAM. However, with the rapid growth in capacity needs for high-performance memory, SRAM is not always sufficient to meet the demands of bandwidth-intense applications. Embedded DRAM (eDRAM) has been explored as an alternative to satisfy the high-performance and density needs in memory [1-3]. In this paper, a high-performance eDRAM based on a 22nm tri-gate CMOS technology is introduced. This eDRAM technology enables the integration of an eDRAM cell into the logic technology platform [4]. The design features a well-balanced configuration to achieve both optimal array efficiency and bandwidth. By leveraging the high-performance and low-voltage tri-gate transistor at 22nm generation, the eDRAM achieves a wide range in operating voltage, from 1.1V down to 0.7V, which is essential for low-power logic applications.",

        "abstract": "With the explosive growth of battery-operated portable devices, the demand for low power and small size has been increasing for system-on-a-chip (SoC). The FinFET is considered as one of the most promising technologies for future low-power mobile applications because of its good scaling ability, high on-current, better SCE and subthreshold slope, and small leakage current [1]. As a key approach for low-power, supply-voltage (VDD) scaling has been widely used in SoC design. However, SRAM is the limiting factor of voltage-scaling, since all SRAM functions of read, write, and hold-stability are highly influenced by increased variations at low VDD, resulting in lower yield. In addition, the width-quantization property of FinFET device reduces the design window for transistor sizing, and increases the failure probability due to the un-optimized bitcell sizing [1]. In order to overcome the bitcell challenges to high yield, peripheral-assist techniques are required. In this paper, we present 14nm FinFET-based 128Mb 6T SRAM chips featuring low-VMIN with newly developed assist techniques.",

        "abstract": "Scaling of process technology is inevitably accompanied by the increase of local variation in transistor characteristics, which has been deteriorating the operation margin of SRAM. This trend necessitates assist circuits for SRAM to increase the immunity against variations, and many papers in this area [1-4] have been published. In this paper, we present an assist circuit suitable for the SRAMs in 20nm generation. Figure 13.3.1 compares local variations of SRAM cell transistors, pass-gate NMOS (PG), pull-down NMOS (PD) and pull-up PMOS (PU) for 28 and 20nm, showing degradation as the process advances. Noticeably, the NMOS transistors become worse than PMOS, which causes degradation in SRAM operating margin since SRAM characteristics such as static noise margin (SNM) are more sensitive to NMOS than PMOS. Figure 13.3.1 also shows the operational window enclosed by read and write immunity against local variations in 28 and 20nm. This indicates assist circuits must perform beyond the level established in previously published work to address SRAM variation in advanced technology nodes. Lowering wordline (WL) voltage level is one of the read-assist approaches. Lowering the supply voltage of PU in a cell (ARVDD) and negative bitline (BL) techniques are known to be effective for the write operation. These techniques, however, have side-effects: lowering the WL voltage degrades write margin and lowering ARVDD leads to higher power consumption and a long cycle-time. Furthermore, the negative BL technique can cause write errors in non-selected columns. Thus, it is necessary to select which assist technique should be applied depending on each process technology. In addition, the SRAM used in production generally include single-port SRAM (SP-SRAM) and dual-port SRAM (DP-SRAM), so the assist circuits to be applied should be effective for whole SRAM family.",

        "abstract": "Battery lifetime is the key feature in the growing markets of sensor networks and energy-management system (EMS). Low-power MCUs are widely used in these systems. For these applications, standby power, as well as active power, is important contributor to the total energy consumption because active sensing or computing phases are much shorter than the standby state. Figure 13.4.1 shows a typical power profile of low-power MCU applications. To achieve many years of battery lifetime, the power consumption of the chip must be kept below 1\u03bcA during deep sleep mode. Another key feature of a low-power MCU for such applications is fast wake-up from deep-sleep mode, which is important for low application latency and to keep wake-up energy minimal. For fast wake-up, the system must retain its state and logged information during sleep mode because several-hundred microseconds are needed for reloading such data to memories. Conventional SRAM consumes much higher retention current than the required deep-sleep-mode current as shown in Fig. 13.4.1. Embedded Flash memories have limited write endurance on the order of 105 cycles making them difficult to use in applications that frequently power down. Embedded FRAM [1,2] has been used for this purpose and it could be used as a random-access memory as well as a nonvolatile memory. However, as a random-access memory, its slow operation and high energy consumption [1,2] limits performance of the MCU and battery lifetime. Furthermore, additional process steps for fabricating FRAM memory cells increase the cost of MCU. SRAM can operate at higher speed with lower energy without additional process steps, but high retention current makes it difficult to sustain data in deep-sleep mode. To solve this problem, we develop low-leakage current SRAM (XLL SRAM) that reduce retention current by 1000\u00d7 compared to conventional SRAM and operate with less than 10ns access time. The retention current of XLL SRAM is negligible in the deep-sleep mode because it is much smaller than the amount of the deep-sleep-mode current of MCU, which is dominated by active current of the real-time clock and control logic circuits. By using XLL SRAM, the store and reload process during mode transitions can be eliminated and wake-up time from deep-sleep mode of MCU is reduced to few microseconds. This paper describes a 128kb SRAM with 3.5nA (27fA/b) retention current, 7ns access time, and 25\u03bcW/MHz active energy consumption. Its low retention current, high-speed, and low-power operation enable to activate SRAM in the deep-sleep mode, and also provides fast wake-up, low active energy consumption and high performance to MCU.",

        "abstract": "FinFET technology has become a mainstream technology solution for post-20nm CMOS technology [1], since it has superior short-channel effects, better sub-threshold slope and reduced random dopant fluctuation. Therefore, it is expected to achieve better performance with lower SRAM VDDMIN. However, the quantized sizing of the channel width and length has drawbacks for conventional 6T-SRAM bitcell scaling. To minimize the bitcell area of the high-density SRAM bitcell, the number of fins (setting the channel width, W) of the pull-up PMOS (PU), passgate NMOS (PG) and pull-down NMOS (PD) transistors must be selected as 1:1:1. Since PU, PG, and PD have the same channel length (L), the ratio in geometry between the PU transistor and the PG transistor is equal to one. With the process variations, the strength of PU transistor can be much stronger than the PG transistor. A stronger PU transistor increases read stability of the SRAM bitcell but it degrades the write margin significantly and results in worse write-VDDMIN issue. Figure 13.5.1(a) shows a contention condition between PU and PG transistors of a 6T-SRAM bitcell for the write operation. During the write operation, the PU transistor impedes the ability of the PG transistor to pull the storage node (S) from VDD to ground. The bitcell may suffer a write failure at the stronger PU with weaker PG condition caused by the device variations. Two techniques have been proposed to improve the high density SRAM bitcell write VDDMIN: 1) negative bit-line voltage (NBL) to increase the strength of PG transistor and 2) lower cell VDD (LCV) to weaken PU transistor strength [1-5]. Compared to the conventional techniques, this work develops a suppressed-coupling-signal negative bitline (SCS-NBL) scheme and a write-recovery-enhancement lower-cell-VDD (WRE-LCV) scheme for write assist without the concern of reliability at higher VDD operating region. A comparison of the effectiveness of the two design techniques is also performed. Figure 13.5.1(b) shows the layout view of the high-density 6T-SRAM bit-cell with 0.07\u03bcm2 area in a 16nm high-k metal-gate FinFET technology. To minimize area, we set the geometric ratio of PU, PG, and PD transistors all equal to one. With the two developed write-assist circuits, the overall VDDMIN improvement can be over 300mV in a 128Mb SRAM test-chip.",

        "abstract": "The number of IPv4 routing table entries was around 460k in 2012 and is growing at a rate of 10% per year. The continuing increase of network-connected devices risks depletion of IPv4 addresses. As for IPv6, the number of routing-table entries is about to reach 16k with a rapid annual growth rate of 90%. This growth trend will continue in the Internet-of-Things era. In growing network applications with large amounts of traffic, there is a demand for routers and switches capable of packet processing for applications such as forwarding, quality of service, classification and access control. Fully parallel ternary content-addressable memories (TCAMs) are the key devices to handle the large number of routes in the lookup table with high-throughput low-latency header processing [1-6]. Realizing both high-density (high-capacity) and high-speed search operation is a challenge due to high power consumption and diminishing signal integrity for search operations. Process scaling is important to achieve a high-density high-performance TCAM, but it incurs the decrease of operating margin caused by threshold-voltage variation. This paper presents a 400MHz 4-paralleled search-operation 80Mb TCAM test-chip in a 28nm process that can accommodate 1M entries. This chip has three key features: flexible search mode, row and column shift redundancy, and search omission with valid-bit. With flexible search mode, the TCAM can be adapted to both IPv4 and IPv6.",

        "abstract": "This work presents an area-efficient and variation-tolerant small-signal differential sensing (VTS) scheme that modifies the conventional SA circuit to include: 1) a structure for on-the-fly, auto-zeroing offset compensation, 2) pre-amplification of bitline differential by reconfiguring the SA inverter pair as amplifiers, and 3) latching of the amplified voltage differential by returning the SA to its conventional cross-coupled configuration. The approach is demonstrated to improve SA robustness over conventional sensing at isosensing time without area overhead (Fig. 13.7.1). Conversely, sensing time can be reduced at iso-robustness and area. Measurements of a 28nm CMOS test chip show that an iso-area VTS scheme improves offset noise tolerance by -1.2\u03c3Vth or sensing speed by up to 42% at iso-robustness (<;0.3% failure rate).",

        "abstract": "Voltage scaling is widely used to improve SRAM energy efficiency [1-2], particularly in mobile systems with tight power budgets. The resulting energy benefits are limited by the minimum voltage ensuring error-free operation, Vmin, which has stagnated due to growing process variation in advanced technology nodes [3]. Error-tolerant applications and systems (e.g., multimedia) allow more aggressive voltage scaling by operating below Vmin, which is acceptable if errors due to bitcell write/read failures do not perceptibly reduce application quality (e.g., image quality). Unfortunately, in traditional SRAMs bit error rate degrades rapidly for VDD <; Vmin [4], limiting energy gains. Under a given quality target, further energy reduction is possible through application-specific methods that exploit the features of data stored in a given application [4-5]. However, these approaches are not reusable across applications, and further the energy-quality trade-off is fixed at design time, which degrades energy savings in applications with lower quality targets and in chips near typical corner.",

        "abstract": "Millimeter-Wave standards like IEEE 802.15.3c and the new 802.11ad have classifications of their PHY to support single-carrier mode and more complex OFDM mode (high-speed interface) with high peak-to-average ratio (PAPR). To improve the efficiency of power amplifiers (PA), the trend is towards Class-AB and Class-B PAs that exhibit better energy efficiency compared to Class-A. However, Class-AB and -B biasing brings along large amplitude-to-phase-modulation (AM-PM) distortion which degrades EVM and ACPR. At the same time, PMOS transistors become attractive in nanometer CMOS as their fMAX exceeds 140GHz. This makes it possible to use both NMOS and PMOS transistors at mm-Wave frequencies. This paper presents a 60GHz complementary Push-Pull PA, using both NMOS and PMOS transistors. An inverter-like architecture which uses both PMOS and NMOS results in the cancellation of AM-PM distortion which is particularly important in high-fidelity amplification of OFDM systems and high-order modulation schemes like 16- and 64-QAM, which are very sensitive to phase distortion. Furthermore, the complementary nature allows deep Class-AB operation, giving a high power efficiency at power back-off comparable to state-of-the-art 60GHz PA structures based on NMOS only.",

        "abstract": "The output power of power amplifiers (PAs) can be increased by using PA arrays and by combining individual PA output powers either on chip with linear combiners or in free space with antenna arrays [1,2]. Therefore, the output power of a PA element can be compromised by the array size. The overall array's power-added-efficiency (PAE) is predominantly determined by the unit PA, which is the most critical performance metric to contain thermal and reliability issues, especially in highly integrated large PA arrays, since thermal density will be proportional to the increase of power density. Class-F and Class-F-1 topologies are promising candidates for a high PAE at microwave and mm-Wave frequencies because on-chip high-Q passive components with a small form-factor will be readily available for a tuned load to terminate multiple harmonics appropriately [3]. Maintaining a high efficiency over a wide bandwidth, however, is challenging because of the narrowband nature of the high-Q networks. This paper presents a highly efficient Class-F-1/F PA in 0.13\u03bcm SiGe BiCMOS achieving 39.3-40.7% PAE over 25 to 30GHz. In the PA, integrated on-chip passive load networks operate cooperatively to shape the load impedance for an in-band mode transition from Class-F-1 to Class-F, maintaining greater than 36.3% PAE over the entire operation band (24 to 31GHz, 25.5% of fractional bandwidth).",

        "abstract": "Recently, silicon-based THz video cameras have been demonstrated for industrial, surveillance, scientific, and medical applications in the THz range (300GHz to 3THz) [1]. Such camera implementations favor pixels with antenna-coupled direct detectors for a low power dissipation and a high pixel count. Despite this progress, they lack the required sensitivity for passive imaging and imagers are in the need of artificial illumination to provide the required image quality. The choice has been to use expensive high-power focused illumination with a single direction for the incoming beam, which seriously limits the image quality due to its specular nature. Additionally, detectors in a focal-plane array configuration share the available source power and the image SNR further drops with the camera resolution. Like imaging at visible light, where shades or reflectors are commonly used, active THz imaging would greatly benefit from incoherent artificial light sources to adjust brightness, phase/frequency, and the direction of light to obtain the desired lighting conditions.",

        "abstract": "In traditional phased arrays as the number of rows and columns increases, the complexity of array connections and phase shifters becomes a major obstacle. This challenge is even more detrimental at mm-Wave and THz frequencies where conductive loss, undesired couplings, phase/gain mismatch, and high power consumption are among many adverse effects of such lengthy connections. To address this issue, this work presents a novel scalable system for THz signal generation and radiation. Figure 14.6.1 shows the architecture consisting of a 2-D array of coupled oscillating elements. Each oscillator with its antenna forms a small THz radiator. While independently radiating, each element is also unidirectionally connected to its neighboring elements in both horizontal and vertical directions through variable phase shifters, \u03c8row and \u03c8col, respectively. This network is inherently scalable because it only relies on couplings with the nearest neighbors and there is no high-frequency global routing to any oscillator. The purpose of this topology is twofold: first to synchronize all the oscillators to a single frequency and next, to set a desired phase shift between the adjacent elements (\u0394\u03c6row and \u0394\u03c6col). We can show that by employing this particular coupling structure only a small subset of all the theoretical coupling modes are physically stable. By proper control of the couplings one can ensure the system settles into the desired coupling mode [1].",

        "abstract": "Signal generation at mm-Wave-to-THz frequencies is attractive because of its applications in bio-sensing, spectroscopy, detection of concealed weapons, as well as high-data-rate communication. CMOS is considered a potential platform to implement a low-cost and high-yield signal generation solution at this frequency range. Despite continuous scaling, effective fmax of active devices is not high enough and hence either harmonic oscillators or frequency multipliers are employed for high-frequency signal generation. In recent CMOS VCO designs, reasonable power levels (~1mW) and tuning range (~10GHz) have been reported at around 300GHz but with very low DC-to-RF efficiency (<;0.4%), which is undesirable for portable applications [1,4]. Moreover, power-level fluctuation is more than 3dB across the frequency range [1]. In this work, we introduce a scalable VCO architecture that efficiently generates and extracts the 2nd harmonic at 256GHz and hence simultaneously achieves high tuning range (16GHz), high output power (2.6mW), high DC-RF efficiency (1.14%), and low phase noise (-94dBc/Hz to -85dBc/Hz at 1MHz offset frequency across the tuning range). When compared to published state-of-the-art, this work demonstrates the highest output power, tuning range, and DC-to-RF efficiency, and the lowest phase noise among all CMOS VCOs above 200GHz.",

        "abstract": "Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are widely used for clock generation in modern digital systems. All-digital PLLs have been proposed to address design issues in conventional analog PLLs. However, current all-digital PLLs require custom circuit design, and therefore cannot fully leverage advanced automated digital design flows. While fully synthesizable PLLs have been reported, they suffer from high power consumption and large area. This arises because each stage of the ring needs to have a large number of parallel tristate buffers/inverters in order to achieve the necessary frequency resolution. Moreover, custom-designed cells are required in prior synthesizable PLLs, introducing additional place-and-route (P&R) steps, leading to poor portability, integration, and scalability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a fully synthesizable PLL based solely on a standard digital library, with a current-output digital-to-analog converter (DAC) for maintaining frequency linearity and duty balance, an interpolative phase-coupled oscillator for minimizing the output phase imbalance from automatic P&R, as well as an edge injection technique for avoiding injection-pulse width issues.",

        "abstract": "Digital phase-locked loops (DPLLs) [1-7] have received considerable attention recently due to their compatibility with advanced CMOS technology. However, there are two critical factors hindering their uptake in SoC products. One factor is that a digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) is highly sensitive to supply noise. A common solution is to apply voltage regulation or to adopt digital calibration [2] at the cost of larger area, higher power consumption or both. The other factor is a power-hungry time-to-digital converter (TDC), which typically requires complex auxiliary circuitry to overcome sensitivity to process, voltage and temperature [3]. A bang-bang phase/frequency detector (BBPFD) is a good alternative to the TDC for low-power small-size applications. A fractional-N implementation, however, still demands a fractional frequency divider with high design complexity [5]. This paper presents a bang-bang all-digital fractional-N PLL, which occupies a small area, consumes low power and addresses the aforementioned issues. A block diagram of the fractional-N DPLL is shown in Fig. 15.2.1. An automatic frequency controller (AFC) tunes a DCO frequency in the foreground for fast locking. The DCO employs a supply-noise canceling architecture to address the power supply noise issue with negligible power and area overhead. We adopt a phase-interpolator-based fractional divider controlled by a walking-one phase selector for low power and compactness.",

        "abstract": "Due to the high supply sensitivity of ring voltage-controlled oscillators (RVCOs) ([oscillation frequency change %] / [VDD change %] typically lies in the range from 1 to 2 [1]), an LDO has to provide over 40dB power-supply-rejection ratio (PSRR) to maintain VCO phase noise. However, the voltage dropout of an LDO consumes extra power and voltage headroom, which is unacceptable in low-voltage design. Moreover, the device noise from the LDO degrades the phase-noise performance. Recently published works [1-5] employ analog compensation techniques to lower supply sensitivity, and [2] incorporates a hybrid background calibration scheme for robustness. However, the additional current sources and active devices embedded in the oscillator [1-5] increase power and noise. In this work, a DCO with passive devices and all-digital calibration mitigates supply sensitivity under PVT variation, while maintaining phase noise and power consumption. The digital background-calibration logic regulates the oscillator supply to an optimally insensitive point by monitoring a digital loop filter (DLF) code, leveraging an advantage of an ADPLL [6].",

        "abstract": "Modern systems-on-chips (SoCs) perform many diverse analog, digital, and mixed-signal functions. They contain a wide variety of modules such as multicore processors, memories, I/O interfaces, power management, and wireless transceivers. Each module has its own unique clock requirements to maximize the overall system performance. For example, dynamic frequency scaling (DFS) saves processor power, spread spectrum clocking (SSC) reduces electromagnetic interference (EMI), and rapid power cycling between idle and active states allows energy-proportional operation. A conventional analog integer-N phase-locked loop (PLL)-based clock generation unit (CGU) occupies large area, has a long lock time, and its output frequency resolution is limited by the reference clock frequency. While the digital fractional-N PLL-based CGU in [1] overcomes some of these drawbacks, it suffers from an intrinsic tradeoff between the time-to-digital converter (TDC)/fractional-divider quantization error and oscillator phase noise. As a result, it requires either a high-resolution TDC or a low-noise oscillator both of which incur power penalty. Further, narrow PLL bandwidth limits SSC modulation frequency and increases lock time making it unsuitable for energy-proportional operation. Open-loop frequency generation using direct-digital synthesis (DDS) overcomes the drawbacks of closed-loop PLLs but it consumes a significant amount of power [2]. This paper presents an all-digital CGU using open-loop fractional dividers. Unlike [1], the proposed CGU, using only one integer-N PLL and a single reference clock, can provide multiple low-jitter outputs over a wide frequency range with fine frequency resolution. It also has SSC capability with programmable modulation depth and achieves instantaneous frequency switching.",

        "abstract": "Energy-efficient networks-on-chip (NoCs) are key enablers for exa-scale computation by shifting power budget from communication toward computation. As core counts scale into the 100s, on-chip interconnect fabrics must support increasing heterogeneity and voltage/clock domains. Synchronous NoCs require either a single clock distributed globally or clock-crossing data FIFOs between clock domains [1]. A global clock requires costly full-chip margining and significant power and area for clock distribution, while synchronizing data FIFOs add power, performance, and area overhead per clock crossing. Source-synchronous NoCs mitigate these penalties by forwarding a local clock along with each packet, but still suffer from high data storage power due to packet switching. Circuit switching removes intra-route data storage, but suffers from low network utilization due to serialized channel setup and data transfer [2]. Hybrid packet/circuit switching parallelizes these operations for higher network utilization. A 16\u00d716 mesh, 112b data, 256 voltage/clock domain NoC with source-synchronous operation, hybrid packet/circuit-switched flow control, and ultra-low-voltage optimizations is fabricated in 22nm tri-gate CMOS [3] to enable: i) 20.2Tb/s total throughput at 0.9V, 25\u00b0C, ii) a 2.7\u00d7 increase in bisection bandwidth to 2.8Tb/s and 93% reduction in circuit-switched latency at 407ps/hop through source-synchronous operation, iii) a 62% latency improvement and 55% increase in energy efficiency to 7.0Tb/s/W through circuit switching, iv) a peak energy efficiency of 18.3Tb/s/W for near-threshold operation at 430mV, 25\u00b0C, and v) ultra-low-voltage operation down to 340mV with router power scaling to 363\u03bcW.",

        "abstract": "True random number generators (TRNGs) use physical randomness as entropy sources and are heavily used in cryptography and security [1]. Although hardware TRNGs provide excellent randomness, power consumption and design complexity are often high. Previous work has demonstrated TRNGs based on a resistor-amplifier-ADC chain [2], oscillator jitter [1], metastability [3-5] and other device noise [6-7]. However, analog designs suffer from variation and noise, making them difficult to integrate with digital circuits. Recent metastability-based methods [3-5] provide excellent performance but often require careful calibration to remove bias. SiN MOSFETs [6] exploit larger thermal noise but require post-processing to achieve sufficient randomness. An oxide breakdown-based TRNG [7] shows high entropy but suffers from low performance and high energy/bit. Ring oscillator (RO)-based TRNGs offer the advantage of design simplicity, but previous methods using a slow jittery clock to sample a fast clock provide low randomness [1] and are vulnerable to power supply attacks [8]. In addition, the majority of previous methods cannot pass all NIST randomness tests.",

        "abstract": "On-chip temperature sensors are key building blocks for the thermal management of multi-core microprocessors. The sensors are embedded at multiple locations in a microprocessor and monitor temperatures that are used to manage the operation of the microprocessor under local and global thermal constraints. While existing sensors achieve impressive area and accuracy, emerging technology trends such as multi-core architectures, 3D integration, tri-gate devices, and low-voltage operation demand even better sensors with difficult-to-meet requirements. Those requirements are three-fold: 1) Sensors need to be area efficient. By increasing the number of cores and hot spots, there are more locations that require thermal monitoring. To reduce the overhead, the sensor footprint needs to be minimized. A compact footprint is further critical for design flexibility, as the exact sensor locations (e.g. near hot spots) are often only identified in later stages of the design process [1]. 2) Sensors need to have low calibration cost, while achieving sufficient accuracy. The requirements of <;8\u00b0C in absolute inaccuracy and <;3\u00b0C in relative inaccuracy have been outlined in [2]. 3) Finally, the sensors need better supply voltage (VDD) scalability. Sub-1V operation for digital systems is being explored to reduce power. The conventional sensors often cannot operate below 1V, necessitating additional power distribution or regulation. Sub-1V scalability eliminates such overhead.",

Multi-stage amplifiers have dominated those buffers due to their reliable DC gain, output swing, gain-bandwidth product (GBW) and slew rate (SR). Yet, different kinds of frequency compensation are also useful for stability, bottlenecking the capacitive-load (CL) drivability, power and area efficiencies.",

The conventional frequency compensation methods, however, are based on cumbersome transfer function derivations or complicated local loop analysis [1]-[3], inhibiting intuitive understanding. An approach is presented in this paper, which generates insight for the poles and zeros through distinctive compensation analysis, and is applicable to large-number-stage amplifiers. The approach applies feedback theory and simplifies high-frequency Miller amplifiers, thereby reducing orders of circuits and improving insight.",

Needs are emerging to perform impedance spectroscopy on a wide frequency range. Electrical assessment of the cell metabolism, for example, requires a frequency of investigation of about 100 MHz for the signal to traverse the cell membrane and to access the cytoplasm. Bench-top impedance analyzers exist that cover such a wide frequency range but they are bulky, expensive and have inadequate resolution for the high impedance shown by many nanosamples and semi-insulating biological molecules. Recent compact analyzers based on custom CMOS chips are mainly focused on low-power solutions with sub-MHz ranges or highly multichannel applications. Here we present a fully-integrated current-to-admittance converter operating from 1kHz to 150MHz with the low noise level of other solutions operating at much lower frequencies.",

        "abstract": "Extremely small-area sensor front-ends are required for cost-constrained automotive applications. Instrumentation amplifiers (IA) for such front-ends must process multi-channel sensor outputs and provide gain matching over the channels for proper sensor operation. Angular sensors are a typical example, in which the sine and cosine outputs of a resistive magnetic sensor must be processed with adequate gain matching to avoid unacceptable angular errors. This paper presents a 2-channel instrumentation amplifier in 0.16\u03bcm CMOS with 0.1% gain matching and occupying 0.035mm2 per channel. This represents a 13.3\u00d7 area improvement with respect to state-of-the-art designs with similar gain accuracy [1]-[4], while maintaining low noise (18.7nV/\u221aHz), low offset (17\u03bcV) and high power efficiency (NEF=12.9). The accurate gain matching in a limited area is enabled by the adoption of a dynamic element matching (DEM) scheme and by the use of a high chopping frequency.",

        "abstract": "Modern wireless communication systems, such as high-speed uplink packet access (HSUPA) or long term evolution (LTE), employ highly spectral-efficient modulations with inherent non-constant envelope signals having high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). These signals require the RF Power Amplifiers (PAs) to be backed off from saturation to satisfy the stringent linearity requirements. Unfortunately, linear operation leads to very low overall system efficiency. The envelope tracking (ET) technique has been identified as one possible solution to improve the global efficiency of the RF transmission chain. This technique has raised interest in the optimization of the fast supply envelope modulator (EM), the most critical component in the system. Several topologies for the EM exist such as fast buck converters, multilevel buck converters [1] and parallel hybrid structures with a class-AB amplifier AC-coupled to a buck converter [2].",

A sleep timer is used to synchronize the data transmission and reception. The total system power is then limited by the sleep power and the sleep timer frequency stability. Low-frequency crystal oscillators are a common choice for sleep timers due to their excellent long-term stability, frequency stability over temperature, and very low power consumption. However, the external crystal cost and board area are undesired. If an integrated oscillator is used as an alternative, the frequency variation must be minimized so the sleep time can be maximized.",

        "abstract": "Technology scaling is leading to supply voltage reduction and shrinking voltage headroom, making it very challenging for analog circuits to achieve high signal-to-noise-and-distortion ratios (SNDRs). For example, at Vdd \u2264 0.6V, the peak signal swing is 30% of Vdd in [1]-[3]. Since timing accuracy is improving in nanoscale CMOS, techniques have been proposed representing analog information in the time or phase domain. However, the linearity of the transformation between time or phase domain and the voltage or current domain remains a bottleneck at low supply voltages. In [2], ring-oscillator based integrators replace conventional OTA-based integrators, but the output signal swing is still limited to 30% of Vdd by the voltage headroom of the charge pump, which performs phase-to-voltage conversion. We propose switched-mode signal processing where analog information is represented in terms of pulse widths at the amplifier output stage, which can be replaced with power-efficient rail-to-rail class-D stages, thus producing switched-mode operational amplifiers (SMOAs). We present a 0.6V 70MHz 4th-order continuous-time Butterworth filter designed with SMOAs that achieves a dynamic range of 58dB, an SNR of 55.8dB and a THD of 60dB at +2.8dBm output signal power, while dissipating 26.2mW.",

        "abstract": "Supplying a regulated 0.6V to biomedical systems requires a low dropout (LDO) regulator with a maximum driving current capability of 10mA. One sub-1V voltage reference circuit is commonly used in the conventional LDO design to generate the reference voltage VREF with a low temperature coefficient (TC), as shown in Fig. 17.10.1. VREF is sent to the inverting terminal of the error amplifier (EA) to regulate the output voltage VOUT. The critical path of the voltage headroom exists between VREF and VIN through the inverting terminal and the tail current of the EA. That is, VIN>VSG+VOV+VREF \u2248|Vtp|+2VOV+VREF, where VIN is the input supply voltage, Vtp is the threshold voltage of the p-type MOSFET and VOV is the overdrive voltage. If the minimum value of VIN is reduced to 0.65V, the derived VREF should be smaller than 50mV when |Vtp| is 0.4V and |VOV| is 0.1V. Such a sub-1V voltage reference circuit is difficult to design [1]-[4]. Even if VREF can be derived, the offset voltage in the EA will seriously affect the exact value of VREF (\u226450mV). In addition, the low noise immunity is another disadvantage that severely affects the performance of the biomedical system.",

        "abstract": "High performance low-dropout regulators (LDOs) are indispensable in a systemon-a-chip (SoC) due to their low output noise, fast transient response and good power supply rejection (PSR) characteristics. In general, differential analog circuit loads need an LDO with high PSR, digital circuit loads need an LDO with fast load transient response, while single-ended analog/RF circuit loads need an LDO with both high PSR and fast transient response. Figure 17.11.1 shows an LDO embedded in an optical receiver that helps improve the sensitivity of the front-end system. On-chip LDOs with PSR in the GHz range are in high demand for wideband optical communication systems because there is only one photo detector in the optical receiver and supply voltage variations would degrade its sensitivity severely.",

        "abstract": "Hearing aids are complex integrated and highly miniaturised systems based on digital signal processor and wireless communication chips. There is a growing need for wireless connectivity between hearing aids and external devices such as cellular phone, PC, sound players (TV, radio, car navigation), remote microphones or even alarm systems. Assistive listening devices based on miniaturized FM receivers [1] operating around 200MHz have been in use for more than 15 years by hearing impaired people. A wireless microphone worn by the speaker (e.g. the teacher in a classroom) captures the speaker's voice clearly and transmits it directly into the hearing aids. Assistive listening devices are essential for increasing speech understanding in noisy situations such as a restaurant, a classroom or a professional meeting. The evolution of FM systems for hearing impaired people has reached its limits and there is a need for a better system, eliminating frequency management by the user, providing worldwide operation, privacy of communication and better audio quality. This paper describes a digital wireless radio SoC for hearing aid applications, operating in the worldwide available 2.4GHz ISM band.",

        "abstract": "A cochlear implant (CI) is a device that electrically stimulates the auditory nerve to restore hearing in people with profound hearing loss. Conventional CIs rely on an external unit comprising a microphone and sound processor to pick up and encode sound. The external unit raises concerns with social stigma and limits usage in the shower or during water sports, motivating the need for a fully-implantable (i.e., invisible) cochlear implant (FICI). The limited energy storage capacity of the implanted system requires low-power (<;1mW total power) sound processing and auditory nerve stimulation to enable operation from an implanted battery that is wirelessly recharged only once daily. Recent state-of-the-art ICs are typically designed for external microphone-based CIs and do not require the neural stimulator to be on the same chip [1]. Prior implantable acoustic sensors such as accelerometers sense the sound-induced vibration of the middle ear, but this approach has limited sensitivity and requires several mW of power for the sensor itself [2].",

        "abstract": "Connected personal healthcare, or Telehealth, requires smart, miniature wearable devices that can collect and analyze physiological and environmental parameters during a user's daily routine. To truly support emerging applications (Fig. 18.3.1), a generic platform is needed that can acquire a multitude of sensor modalities and has generic energy-efficient signal processing capabilities. SoC technology gives significant advantages for miniaturization. But meeting low-power, medical grade signal quality, multi-sensor support and generic signal processing is still a challenge. For instance, [1] demonstrated a multi-sensor interface but it lacks support for efficient on-chip signal processing and doesn't have a high performance AFE. [2] showed a very low power signal processor but without support for multi-sensor interfacing. [3] presented a highly integrated SoC but lacking power efficiency. This paper demonstrates a highly integrated low-power SoC with enough flexibility to support many emerging applications. A wide range of sensor modalities are supported including 3-lead ECG and bio-impedance via high-performance and low-power AFE. The ARM Cortex\u2122 M0 processor and matrix-multiply-accumulate accelerator can execute numerous biomedical signal processing algorithms (e.g. Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA,) CWT, feature extraction/classification, etc.) in an energy efficient way without sacrificing flexibility. The diversity in supported modalities and the generic processing capabilities, all provided in a single-chip low-power solution, make the proposed SoC a key enabler for emerging personal health applications (Fig. 18.3.1).",

        "abstract": "Approximately 1 in 8 U.S. women will develop breast cancer over the course of her lifetime, and breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other cancer, besides lung cancer. In 2013, an estimated 232,340 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S. and about 39,620 women in the U.S. are expected to die from breast cancer [1]. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), if breast cancer can be detected and treated early, one-third of these cancer deaths could be prevented. For the early detection of breast cancer, X-ray mammography and ultrasonic screening are mainly used in hospitals. However, for personal cancer detection at home, currently, only unscientific palpation can be used, which is not particularly effective for early detection of tumors.",

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first EEG test for diagnosing attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in 2013 [1]. The EEG signals are measured by an EEG cap and analyzed by a high performance computer to extract not only the EEG power at a predetermined frequency and site combinations, but also the degree of coherence between all sites. Based on these results, brain stimulation is performed to modulate brain rhythms (EEG) toward the normal values for the therapy.",

        "abstract": "Heterogeneously integrated and miniaturized neural sensing microsystems for accurately capturing and classifying signals are crucial for brain function investigation and neural prostheses realization [1]. Many neural sensing microsystems have been proposed to provide small form-factor and biocompatible properties, including stacked multichip [2, 3], microsystem with separated neural sensors [4], monolithic packaged microsystem [5] and through-silicon-via (TSV) based double-side integrated microsystem [6]. These heterogeneous biomedical devices are composed of sensors and CMOS circuits for biopotential acquisition, signal processing and transmission. However, the weak signals detected from sensors in [2-5] have to pass through a string of interconnections to the CMOS circuits by wire bonding. In view of this, TSV-based double-side integration [6] uses TSV arrays to transfer the weak signals from \u03bc-probe arrays to CMOS circuits for reducing noises. Nevertheless, the double-side integration requires preserving large area for separate \u03bc-probe arrays and TSV arrays, and the TSV fabrication process may induce damage on CMOS circuits.",

        "abstract": "As implantable medical CMOS devices become a reality [1], motion control of such implantable devices has become the next challenge in the advanced integrated micro-system domain. With integrated sensors and a controllable propulsion mechanism, a micro-system will be able to perform tumor scan, drug delivery, neuron stimulation, bio-test, etc, in a revolutionary way and with minimum injury. Such devices are especially suitable for human hollow organs, such as urinary bladder and stomach. Motivated by the art reported in ISSCC 2012 [2], we demonstrate a remotely-controlled locomotive CMOS IC which is realized in TSMC 0.35\u03bcm technology. As illustrated in Fig. 18.7.1, a bare CMOS chip flipped on a liquid surface can be moved to the desired position without any wire connections. Instead of Lorentz forces [2], this chip utilizes the gas pressure resulting from electrolytic bubbles as the propulsive force. By appointing voltages to the on-chip electrolysis electrodes, one can decide the electrolysis location and thereby control the bubbles emissions as well as the direction of motion. With power management circuits, wireless receiver and micro-control unit (MCU), the received signal can be exploited as the movement control as well as wireless power. Experiments show a moving speed of 0.3mm/s of this chip. The total size is 21.2mm2 and the power consumption of the integrated circuits and the electrolysis electrodes are 125.4\u03bcW and 82\u03bcW, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Mobile devices have made remarkable advances in recent years. They generally use embedded NAND storage devices, which are tiny (10s of millimeters square) and low-power (around 1W in the active state) single BGA packages that contain both a controller and NAND chips. Figure 19.3.1 shows read performance of recent embedded NAND storage device products and the maximum link speeds in their standards. The figure indicates that more powerful embedded NAND storage devices are desired by the market. In particular, universal Flash storage (UFS) 2.0, the latest standard, defines high link speed, which is 3\u00d7 faster than the recent embedded multimedia card (eMMC). In this context, we develop a UFS 2.0 device that introduces new features to the conventional embedded NAND storage device controller architecture to improve read performance. Figure 19.3.2 shows a block diagram of our controller. We improve the read performance in the following ways: 1) suppress the number of NAND read accesses and reduce the read latency by introducing unified memory (UM) and caching data for address translations on it, 2) increase the number of NAND chips activated simultaneously with dedicated hardware and new command scheduling, and 3) maximize bandwidth by supporting 5.8Gb/s 2-lane M-PHY link with low-power analog circuits.",

        "abstract": "Resistive RAM (ReRAM) is a promising nonvolatile memory with low write energy, logic-process compatibility, and compact cell area. The 1T1R ReRAM [1-3] fits embedded applications requiring fast read (RD) access time (TAC) and low RD-VDDMIN, particularly for devices powered by batteries or energy harvesters. The cross-point ReRAM [4-6] is meant for high capacities with high RD-VDDMIN and slow TAC. As devices shrink, ReRAMs have higher cell resistance (R) and greater variations in write time and R, which reduces the R-ratio (RH/RL) between the high-R state (HRS, RH) and low-R state (LRS, RL). ReRAM also have a high RL, which enables a larger voltage drop across ReRAM to reduce write voltage and cell-switch (CS) size. Thus, ReRAM macro designs suffer: (1) small sensing margin (SM), limited RD-VDDMIN, and slow TAC due to high-RL and small R-ratio; (2) increase in energy due to large set DC-current (IDC-SET) resulting from wide set-time (TSET) distribution. This study develops a swing-sample-and-couple (SSC) voltage-mode sense amplifier (VSA) to overcome (1), enabling 1.8\u00d7 greater SM for lower RD-VDDMIN and 1.7\u00d7 faster TAC across various VDD, compared to conventional differential-input (CD) VSAs. To reduce >99% set energy, we use a 4T self-boost-write-termination (SBWT) scheme to cut off IDC-SET of faster-TSET devices, with an area penalty below 0.5%. A fabricated 28nm 1Mb ReRAM macro achieves TAC = 404ns at VDD = 0.27V and confirms the IDC-SET cut-off by SBWT.",

The difficulties include shrinking the NAND cell and increasing manufacturing costs due to quadruple patterning and extreme ultraviolet lithography, motivating the development of the next-generation node beyond 16nm-class NAND Flash [4]. In this paper, as a new 3D memory device with lower manufacturing cost and superior device scalability, we present a true 3D 128Gb 2b/cell vertical-NAND (V-NAND) Flash. The chip accomplishes 50MB/s write throughput with 3K endurance for typical embedded applications such as mobile and personal computer. Also, extended endurance of 35K is achieved with 33MB/s of write throughput for data center and enterprise SSD applications.",

The storage controller enhances reliability and performance through five techniques with minimal area overhead.

Techniques (iv) balanced RAID-5/6 and (v) bits/cell optimization (BCO) are applied to 2Xnm TLC NAND to reduce the failure rate by 98% and extend the lifetime (write/erase (W/E) cycles) by >22\u00d7, respectively.",

Previous ReRAM designs demonstrating high performance have done so on low density arrays (<;1Gb) while those reporting high-density arrays (>8Gb) were accompanied by relatively low read and write performance [1-5]. This work describes a 16Gb ReRAM designed in a 27nm node, with a 1GB/s DDR interface and an 8-bank concurrent DRAM-like core architecture. High parallelism, a pipelined data-path architecture and innovations such as concurrent set/reset verify combine to achieve 200MB/s write and 1GB/s read throughputs in a high-density device.",

Its broad bandwidth, combined with a high allowed transmitted power level, provides an excellent opportunity for numerous applications, among others high-precision ranging and localization. Despite being readily available at 60GHz, high bandwidths come with a significant power penalty in the baseband. The presented work brings a solution that delivers high ranging precision at heavily reduced processing bandwidths and sparse-bandwidth power allocations.",

        "abstract": "The IEEE 802.11ad standard supports PHY rates up to 6.7Gb/s on four 2GHz-wide channels from 57 to 64GHz. A 60GHz system offers higher throughput than existing 802.11ac solutions but has several challenges for high-volume production including: integration in the host platform, automated test, and high link loss due to blockage and polarization mismatch. This paper presents a full-featured 802.11ad chipset capable of SC and OFDM modulation using a 16TX-16RX beamforming RF front-end, complete with an antenna array that supports polarization diversity. To aid low-cost integration in PC platforms, a single coaxial cable interface is used between chips. The chipset includes MAC, PHY, and RF with a PCIeTM interface and is capable of maintaining a link of 4.6Gb/s (PHY rate) at 10m.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a 64-QAM 60GHz CMOS transceiver, which achieves a TX-to-RX EVM of -26.3dB and can transmit 10.56Gb/s in all four channels defined in IEEE802.11ad/WiGig. By using a 4-bonded channel, 28.16Gb/s can be transmitted in 16QAM. The front-end consumes 251mW and 220mW from a 1.2-V supply in transmitting and receiving mode, respectively. Figure 20.3.1 shows the 60GHz direct-conversion front-end design. The transmitter consists of a 6-stage PA, differential preamplifiers, I/Q passive mixers and a quadrature injection-locked oscillator (QILO). The receiver consists of a 4-stage LNA, differential amplifiers, I/Q double-balanced mixers, a QILO, and baseband amplifiers. A direct-conversion architecture is employed for both TX and RX because of wide-bandwidth capability [1]. The LO consists of the 60GHz QILO and a 20GHz PLL. The 60GHz QILO works as a frequency tripler with the integrated 20GHz PLL. It can generate 7 carrier frequencies with a 36/40MHz reference, 58.32GHz(ch.1), 60.48GHz(ch.2), 62.64GHz(ch.3), and 64.80GHz(ch.4) defined in IEEE802.11ad/WiGig, 59.40GHz(ch.1-2), 61.56GHz(ch.2-3), and 63.72GHz(ch.3-4) for the channel bonding.",

        "abstract": "A fully-integrated single-chip CMOS transceiver with MAC and PHY for 60GHz proximity wireless communication is presented. A 60GHz wireless communication single-chip transceiver has not yet been reported due to large power consumption issues. However, by limiting the application to high-throughput proximity transmission, thermal issues arising in a single-chip have been overcome. A 2GHz broadband OFDM single-chip transceiver suffers from SNR degradation due to the reference clock (REFCLK) and baseband clock (BBCLK) spurs in RF/analog circuits. Low frequency spurs in the clock generator (CLKPLL) due to the mixing of the ADC/DAC sampling clock (SCLK) and other clocks such as REFCLK and BBCLK have been eliminated by careful frequency planning of those clocks. In addition to that, spur suppression in digital baseband and noise-tolerant RF/analog circuit designs are employed. The spurs have been successfully suppressed to less than \u221235dBc. The chip achieves a PHY data-rate of 2.35Gb/s and MAC throughput of 2.0Gb/s at a distance of 4cm. Power consumption is scalable to the throughput by the introduction of fast Sleep and Awake modes. The average power consumption at a throughput of 0.2Gb/s is reduced to 36% of that at 2.0Gb/s.",

        "abstract": "The steep growth of digital-content consumption and increasing reliance on wireless networks has resulted in emerging standards such as IEEE 802.11ac. By employing spatial diversity, Multi-user MIMO and high-density modulation (up to 256-QAM), 802.11ac MIMO radios can provide significantly increased throughput, link robustness, and range while maintaining backward-compatibilities with existing 802.11a/n WLAN [1]. However, wide signal bandwidth and high-density modulation lead to significant challenges in all aspects of RF transceiver design, compared to previous WLAN standards. This paper introduces a fully integrated 3-stream MIMO WLAN SoC that integrates all of the functions of an 802.11a/b/g/n/ac WLAN with a record over-the-air TCP/IP throughput of 1.1Gb/s. The 40nm CMOS SoC integrates dual-band (2.4GHz and 5GHz) RF transceivers, data converters, digital physical layer, media access controller, and a PCI Express Gen-2 interface. The RF transceiver employs an all-digital fractional-N PLL with a record Figure-of-Merit (FoM) of -244dB, a wideband low-impedance bias circuit that minimizes pre-PA driver memory effect for 80MHz signal bandwidth, a dual-band receiver with 3dB/4.3dB NF, and a 5th-order Chebyshev low-pass filter with constant-Gm bias and pre-distorted filter coefficients to support up to 80MHz signal bandwidth.",

        "abstract": "The demand for lower cost and form factor and increased re-configurability in wireless systems has driven the investigation of blocker-tolerant software-defined radios [1-4]. While promising, a reduction in system form-factor will result in lower isolation among antennas due to the co-existence of multiple ratios or lower isolation within duplexers for FDD systems due to their reduced size and/or increased re-configurability. Out-of-band (OOB) powerful modulated TX-leakage due to limited antenna/duplexer isolation imposes challenges that are more severe than those posed by continuous-wave (CW) blockers by several orders of magnitude, including cross-modulation, second-order intermodulation and TX noise in the RX band (Fig. 20.6.1). Analysis shows that in the face of 0dBm peak TX leakage and a -30dBm CW in-band jammer, to achieve -90dBm sensitivity with 7dB SNR over 2MHz signal BW, a transceiver must exhibit +30dBm receiver OOB IIP3 and -160dBc/Hz TX noise in RX band.",

        "abstract": "The introduction of inductorless frequency synthesizers into standardized wireless systems still requires a high level of innovation in order to achieve the stringent requirements of low noise and low power consumption. Synthesizers based on the so-called multiplying delay-locked loop (MDLL) represent one of the most promising architectures in this direction [1-3]. An MDLL resembles a ring oscillator, in which the signal edge traveling along the delay line is periodically refreshed by a clean edge of the reference clock. In this manner, the phase noise of the ring oscillator is filtered up to half the reference frequency and the total output jitter is reduced significantly. Unfortunately, the concept of MDLL, and in general of injection locking (IL), is inherently limited to integer-N synthesis, which makes it unacceptable in practical RF systems. A first extension of injection locking to coarse fractional-N resolution has been shown in [4], in which however the fractional resolution is bounded to the inverse of the number of ring-oscillator delay stages. This paper introduces a fractional-N MDLL-based frequency synthesizer with a 1b time/digital converter (TDC), which is able to outreach the performance of inductorless fractional-N synthesizers. The prototype synthesizes frequencies between 1.6 and 1.9GHz with 190Hz resolution and achieves RMS integrated jitter of 1.4ps at 3mW power consumption, even in the worst-case of near-integer channel.",

        "abstract": "Direct-digital frequency synthesizers (DDFSs) have been employed in many frequency-agile communication systems because of their wide bandwidth, fine frequency resolution, and fast frequency-hopping characteristics. Recent developments in DDFSs are towards enhancing performances through reduction of both complexity and power consumption [1-3]. The segmented nonlinear DAC (NLDAC) structures in [1,2] require additional coarse phase information for fine amplitude decoding with a complex decoder. Moreover, the quarter-sine-wave technique incorporated into the segmented NLDACs in [1,2] degrades spectral purity due to the need of the MSB shift DAC that introduces additional offset. Another scheme in [3] reduces complexity and power consumption by replacing the digital-based phase-to-amplitude converter with an analog-based converter, resulting in limited spectral purity. Unlike previous schemes, this work presents comprehensive enhancements in all key areas of a DDFS, the pipelined phase accumulator (PACC), digital decoder, and NLDAC as shown in Fig. 21.3.1. First, the low-power PACC with multi-level momentarily activated bias (M2AB) is presented to reduce power dissipation. Second, the coarse phase-based consecutive fine-amplitude grouping (C2FAG) scheme reduces the hardware complexity and the power consumption in digital decoder circuits. Third, the mixed-wave conversion topology (MCT) in the NLDAC improves the output spectral purity.",

        "abstract": "For high data-rate communication at 60GHz using the IEEE 802.11ad standard, the LO synthesis needs both a low-noise VCO and low in-band phase noise. In the PLL shown in this paper, a QVCO with superharmonic passive coupling exhibits a large swing and low phase noise even with a 0.9V supply. In-band phase noise is reduced thanks to the use of a sub-sampling phase detector (SSPD), earlier introduced for low-GHz PLLs [1]. As most of the divider chain and the charge pump (CP) can be powered down in the sub-sampling mode, power consumption is also reduced.",

The simplest method to generate I and Q signals in the LO is to use a frequency divide-by-2 which requires the VCO frequency to be an even multiple of fLO. This method is area efficient and superior for coexistence as it does not generate jammers in other bands. The technique in this work expands the VCO frequency range to ensure 2xfLO for all cellular bands, notably 3700MHz, with sufficient margin, and meets the most stringent PN specification for a SAW-less GSM transceiver.",

        "abstract": "Despite recent attempts to relax the phase-noise demands on voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs) for cellular communications [1], mainstream radios require harmonic VCOs capable of a very low phase noise with moderate power consumption, associated to a large tuning range (TR) and a high insensitivity to interfering signals. Ideally, the TR should be in excess of one octave, since this allows the easy synthesis of all frequencies below those directly generated by the VCOs via repeated frequency divisions by 2. At the same time, the oscillation spectrum should be affected as little as possible by spurious (common-mode) magnetic fields impinging on the inductor coil in the VCO tank. This is a crucial requirement in modern radios, where there are more PLLs active at the same time, and particularly when (non-contiguous) carrier aggregation is implemented, since in this case the signal bands may be very close to each other. If an individual PLL is used for each band, the VCOs may oscillate very close to each other, or at frequencies that are harmonically related to each other, posing a very serious issue of mutual pulling through the respective magnetic field. And even if a single VCO is used [2], or two (or more) VCOs that are not harmonically related [3], it is nevertheless a good practice to design the tank inductor as insensitive as possible to external magnetic fields, which abound in and close to the radio IC.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents an ultra-low-power 2.4GHz receiver for the IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) standard. Traditional short-range ISM-band radios require a PLL-based frequency synthesizer for channelization across the band of interest [1-3]. The lowest ZigBee power consumption found in the literature to date is 1.6mW (RX) and 1.8mW (PLL) by employing a sliding-IF architecture [1]. [4] proposes a BAW-based 2.4GHz ZigBee receiver that saves power by eliminating the off-chip quartz crystal with super-high IF architecture; however, 8.2mW DC power is consumed since a low frequency LC-PLL is necessary for channel select tuning. The Blixer in [5] reduced the RX DC power through current re-use; however, the LO generator suffers from high power consumption due to the high-frequency quadrature LO.",

        "abstract": "Despite versatility and low power consumption, direct-conversion transmitters suffer from a fundamental drawback: the local oscillator disturbance by the power amplifier, through unwanted electromagnetic or capacitive coupling [1,2]. As shown in Fig. 21.8.1, the pulled oscillator spectrum is no longer a single-tone sinusoid, which can drastically degrade the transmitter EVM or spectrum mask. To alleviate this, time-consuming and often unpredictable optimization of the floor plan, package, and PCB is required to maximize the isolation between the PA and VCO. Ultimately, this issue may prohibit the use of this architecture for many applications, leading to higher power consumption. Moreover, in many modern radios it is common to have more than one VCO on-chip (Fig. 21.8.1) to support various features such as FDD, carrier aggregation, or coexistence, further exacerbating the problem through multiple-VCO cross-coupling. To address these concerns we propose a calibration scheme that corrects any pulling effect regardless of its source or magnitude. Our approach is fully digital and is automatically calibrated, leading to a reliable and robust solution, and has little impact on power consumption, size, or transmitter noise.",

SAR ADCs and interleaved ADCs made impressive progress in recent years. First CMOS ADCs with at least 6b and conversion rates exceeding 20GS/s were presented, proving that interleaved SAR ADCs are an optimal choice for high-speed ADCs with moderate resolution. We present an interleaved CMOS ADC architecture based on an asynchronous redundant SAR ADC core element. It was measured up to a sampling rate of 100GS/s and can be operated from a single supply voltage. At 90GS/s, the measured SNDR stays above 36.0dB SNDR up to 6.1GHz and 33.0dB up to 19.9GHz input frequency while consuming 667mW. The ADC is implemented in 32nm digital SOI CMOS and occupies 0.45mm2.",

However, the time-interleaved channels suffer from process mismatch, particularly for timing skew. Although a power-consuming two-rank track-and-hold (T/H) can prevent such timing-skew problems, distributed T/Hs can be used for lower-power operation with timing-skew calibration to meet the skew specifications of 200fsrms for 6b resolution and 10GHz input signals. Instead of using software calibration with Fourier analysis [1-3], requiring a special input reference signal [4], or relying on the statistics of the input signal [5], this work presents a low-complexity on-chip background calibration technique to reduce gain, offset, and delay mismatches between channels. This enables small-size transistors to be used in comparators and clock delivery circuits to avoid serious noise coupling and save considerable power for such an ultra-high-speed system. The presented 8-way time-interleaved 20GS/s 6b ADC achieves an SNDR of 30.7dB at Nyquist and consumes only 69.5mW.",

A 6b 10GS/s ADC able to acquire up to 20GHz input signal frequency and showing 5.3 ENOB in Nyquist condition is presented. It is based on a Master Track & Hold (T&H) followed by a time-interleaved synchronous SAR ADC, thus avoiding the need for any kind of skew or bandwidth calibration. Ultra Thin Body and BOX Fully Depleted SOI (UTBB FDSOI) 28nm CMOS technology is used for its fast switching and regenerating capability. The core ADC consumes 32mW from 1V power supply and occupies 0.009mm2 area. The FoM is 81fJ/conversion step.",

        "abstract": "SARs are one of the most energy-efficient ADC architectures for medium resolution and low-to-medium speed. To improve the limited bandwidth of SAR ADCs, the time-interleaved (TI) structure is often used [1,2]. However, TI ADCs have several issues caused by mismatches between channels, such as offset, gain, and timing-skew errors. Unlike the other errors, timing-skew causes errors that increase with input signal frequency. Considering that the TI structure is typically employed to increase bandwidth, timing-skew can be a dominant error source of TI ADCs. Recent works [1,3] have demonstrated a background timing-skew calibration using a dedicated additional channel as a timing reference. In this work, we present a TI SAR ADC that enables background timing-skew calibration without a separate timing reference channel and enhances the conversion speed of each channel.",

        "abstract": "Today's applications such as broadband satellite receivers, cable TVs, and software-defined radios require highly efficient ADCs with high sampling rates and high resolutions. A time-interleaved ADC (TIADC) is a popular architecture used to achieve this goal. However, this structure suffers from mismatches between the sub-converters, which cause errors on the output signal, and more significantly, decrease the SFDR. These mismatches can be a severe limitation in applications such as satellite reception, where both narrowband and wideband signals are used. This paper introduces digital derivative-based estimation of timing mismatches. Gain, offset and skew mismatch calibrations are performed entirely in the digital domain through equalization.",

        "abstract": "High-speed low-resolution ADCs are widely used for various applications, such as 60GHz receivers, serial links, and high-density disk drive systems. Flash architectures have the highest conversion rate without employing time interleaving. Moreover, flash architectures have the lowest latency, which is often required in feedback-loop systems. However, the area and power consumption are exponentially increased by increasing the resolution since the number of comparators must be 2N. A folding architecture is a well-known technique to reduce the number of comparators in an ADC while maintaining high sampling rate and low latency [1,2]. Folding architectures were previously realized by generating a number of zero crossings with folding amplifiers. However, the conventional folding amplifiers consume a large amount of power to realize a fast response. In contrast, a folding ADC with only dynamic power consumption and without using amplifiers is reported in [3]. However, only a folding factor of 2 is realized, and therefore the number of comparators is reduced by half.",

        "abstract": "Design of low-voltage and efficient energy-harvesting circuits is becoming increasingly important, particularly, for autonomous systems. Since the amount of energy that can be harvested from the surrounding environment is limited, the available output voltage of a harvester is low. Therefore, the design of a low-input-voltage (low-VIN) up-converter is critical to self-powered systems [1-3]. Moreover, the form factor is very constrained in applications such as wearable electronic devices and sensor networks. Recently, low-VIN charge pumps (CPs) for energy harvesting has been compared with DC-DC converters using a large inductor [1-3]. CPs introduced in [1] and [2] use the advanced process technology to push VIN down to the subthreshold region. The CP in [1] introduces a forward-body-biasing (FBB) technique, which improves the voltage conversion efficiency (VCE) for low VIN but shows poor power conversion efficiency (PCE). The CP in [2] achieves the lowest operation voltage. However, the design with a 10-stage CP provides low output power. This paper presents a CP with switching-body-biasing (SBB), adaptive-dead-time (AD), and switch-conductance (SW-G) enhancement techniques to improve the PCE for low VIN as well as to extend the maximum load current.",

        "abstract": "A wireless sensor that is powered from the endocochlear potential (EP), a 70-to-100mV bio-potential inside the mammalian ear, has been demonstrated in [1]. Due to the anatomical size and physiological constraints inside the ear, a maximum of 1.1 to 6.25nW can be extracted from the EP. The nanowatt power budget of the sensor gives rise to unique challenges with power conversion efficiency and quiescent current reduction in the power management unit (PMU). While [1] presents the system aspects of the biomedical harvesting including the biologic interface and system measurements, this work presents the details of the nanowatt PMU required to power the electronics. More specifically, it focuses on the low-power circuit design techniques needed to realize a nW power converter that is applicable to a broad spectrum of emerging biomedical applications with ultra-low energy-harvesting sources.",

Energy harvesting is an attractive way to power such systems due to limited energy capacity of batteries at these form factors. However, the same size limitation restricts the amount of harvested power, which can be as low as 10s of nW for mm-scale photovoltaic cells in indoor conditions.

        "abstract": "A major challenge with emerging microsensors, biomedical implants, and other portable devices is operational life, because tiny batteries exhaust quickly. And even though 1g fuel cells store 5 to 10\u00d7 more energy than 1g Li-ion batteries, fuel cells supply 10 to 20\u00d7 less power [1]. This means fuel cells last longer with light loads and Li-ion batteries output more power across shorter periods. Therefore, when the peak power is far greater than the average power, which, for example, is typically the case in wireless sensors, a hybrid source can occupy less space than a single source [1]. Still, managing a fuel cell and a battery to supply a load and recharge the battery, which also acts as an output, with little space is difficult. Switched-inductor circuits are appealing in this context because they draw and supply more power with higher efficiency than their linear and switched-capacitor counterparts. Inductors, however, are bulky, and thus microsystems can only rely on one inductor [2-3]. Today, most single-inductor multiple-output systems derive power from one source [3, 4, 6], and therefore, the fuel cell and the battery require considerable space. Systems that use two sources either do not manage how much power each source should supply across loading conditions [5], or if they do [2] their efficiency is low. The advantage of the prototyped 0.18\u03bcm CMOS dual-source single-inductor system presented here is its less overall volume because it incorporates the functional intelligence of [2] with much higher efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Energy harvesting is one of the key technologies used to realize self-sustaining systems such as wireless sensor networks and health-care devices. Much research on circuit design has been conducted to extract as much energy as possible from transducers, such as the thermoelectric generator (TEG) and the piezoelectric transducer (PZT). Specifically, the energy in a PZT could be extracted more efficiently by utilizing resonance as [1] and [2] demonstrated. However, the maximum output voltage swing in those techniques are limited to twice of the original swing of the PZT, and thus, had a limited energy extraction capability in spite of more energy being available from the PZT. In [3], on the other hand, the large energy is obtained with higher voltage swing, but is limited up to 247% because the load energy is used to increase the output voltage swing of PZT. To obtain far more power from PZT, we propose an alternative resonance technique through which the PZT output swing can be boosted as high as CMOS devices can sustain. This technique is applied to a dual-energy-sourced (PZT and TEG) energy-harvesting interface (EHI) as a battery charger.",

        "abstract": "Standalone systems such as outdoor lighting and remote monitoring stations can be self-powered by solar panels (SPs) having output powers of tens of watts. When the size of the SP is large, part of it can be shaded by birds, trees and other objects resulting in partial shading conditions (PSCs). Multiple local maxima in the power-versus-voltage (P-V) curve of the SP are generated during PSCs. Based on a 10W SP measurement, ~30% of the available power of the SP can be lost if an energy harvester only operates at the lower local maximum power point during PSC. This issue was previously addressed by using the approach of module-integrated converters (MIC), which are tied to smaller modules of the SP. Since none of the previously reported integrated maximum power point tracking (MPPT) techniques in MIC can track the global maximum power point (GMPP) of the P-V curve, the number of MICs would have to increase significantly in a large-size tens-of-watt SP. This increases the volume, weight, and cost of the photovoltaic system. In addition, previous harvester ICs have adopted the constant-frequency pulse-width-modulation control scheme, which has significant switching power loss under low solar irradiance.",

        "abstract": "Energy harvesting is a key technology in various small-size applications such as wireless sensor nodes, mobile devices, and implantable bio-devices to improve battery lifetime or to substitute for batteries. Piezoelectric (PE) transducers are popular energy harvesters that can be used to supply AC power at the \u03bcW to mW scale to electronic devices using ambient vibrational energy. To use PE energy effectively, the harvesting systems need a highly efficient AC-DC converter and a DC-DC converter with maximum power point tracking (MPPT). However, existing sub-mW converters do not include an integrated MPPT algorithm [1, 2] or use the perturb and observe MPPT method which has long tracking time [3, 4]. This long tracking time reduces the power extraction from the transducer because the maximum power point (MPP) of the input power can be changed frequently according to the environment. In this paper, a low-power harvesting system is presented that finds the MPP of the input power in one cycle of the vibration of the PE transducer.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in MEMS-based oscillators have resulted in their proliferation in timing applications that were once exclusive to quartz-based devices [1]. For applications requiring low phase noise - e.g., cellular, GPS and high-speed serial links - one possible approach is to bias the MEMS resonator at a higher DC voltage to reduce its motional impedance and increase signal energy [2]. Realizing high-voltage charge pumps in bulk CMOS technology is limited by the breakdown voltage of the well/substrate diodes shown in Fig. 23.8.1(a) and Fig. 23.8.1(b). This breakdown limit is even lower with technology scaling and is <;10V in a 22nm CMOS node. Systems with high-voltage requirements often resort to older, high-voltage-tolerant nodes or exotic technologies that limit MEMS integration into SoCs. This work demonstrates a charge pump design in 65nm technology with a three-fold increase in the output voltage range. Highvoltage tolerance is enabled by the proposed well-biasing arrangement and oxide isolation. The pump achieves 34V output by using three different charge pump cells that tradeoff achievable voltage range and power efficiency to achieve a peak efficiency of 38%. Additionally, finger capacitors are optimized to ensure reliability while maintaining efficiency.",

While action potential (AP) recording through penetrating electrode arrays offers the highest spatial resolution, it comes at the price of tissue scarring, resulting in signal degradation over the course of several months [1]. Electrocorticography (ECoG) is an electrophysiological technique where electrical potentials are recorded from the surface of the cerebral cortex, reducing cortical scarring. However, today's clinical ECoG implants are large, have low spatial resolution (0.4 to 1cm) and offer only wired operation.",

Current-controlled stimulation (CCS) enables precise charge control and safe operation, but it has low power efficiency due to the dropout voltage across current sources [1,2]. Switched-capacitor stimulation (SCS), proposed in [3], takes advantage of both high efficiency and safety using capacitor banks to transfer charge to the tissue, but it requires an efficient on-chip capacitor charging system, directly from the inductive link. We present an integrated wireless SCS system-on-a-chip with inductive capacitor charging and charge-based stimulation capabilities, which can improve both stimulator (before electrodes) and stimulus (after electrodes) efficiencies in DBS.",

In arrhythmia studies and treatment, long-term observation is critical to determine the nature of the abnormality and its severity. However, even small body-wearable systems can impact a patient's everyday life and signals captured using such systems are prone to noise from sources such as 60Hz power and body movement. In contrast, implanted devices are less susceptible to these noise sources and, while having closer-spaced electrodes, can obtain similar quality ECG signals due to their proximity to the heart [1]. In addition, implanted devices enable continuous monitoring without affecting patient quality of life. As in other implantable systems, low power consumption is a critical factor; in this case to provide a sufficiently long operating time between wireless recharge events.",

In order to guarantee a long life span of the device, saving power in the sensing IC is a primary concern as cardiac rhythm disorders must be continuously monitored [1]. Shifting the functionality of QRS-band power parameter extraction to the analog domain can reduce system-level power consumption of heartbeat detection significantly through minimizing computational complexity of the DSP [2,3]. In addition, current biomedical ICs still require further improvement of power efficiency as their analog back ends consume significant power [2-4]. For low-power means, the presented analog signal processor (ASP) introduces a power-efficient analog feature extraction, a current-multiplexed ADC driver and a flexible ADC. This advances the state of the art by reducing the power consumption of the ASP below 1\u03bcW without compromising other specs, such as input SNR >70dB, CMRR >90dB, PSRR >80dB, and enables low-power heartbeat detection for implantable pacemakers.",

        "abstract": "Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most frequently acquired infection among patients that receive mechanical ventilation in the intensive-care unit (ICU). The mortality rate for VAP lies in the 20-to-50% range and could be even higher in some ICUs. A standard operation procedure to VAP treatment includes a sequence of chest radiography, sputum gram stain, sputum culture, and empiric therapy, initially with antibiotics covering broad pathogens. However, collection of the gram stain and culture of lower respiratory tract specimen is usually not time-efficient (up to 5 days), delaying the initiation of therapy and unacceptable for critically ill patients. A rapid and accurate diagnosis for VAP is therefore crucial, but still unavailable. It is known that microorganisms generate complex metabolites during infection. Fast detection is feasible by examining metabolic wastes in proximal end of the expiratory device, demanding a miniaturized, battery-powered, gas-sensing device. In this work, a fully integrated low-power nose-on-a-chip with a robust learning kernel is developed for such a vital clinical need.",

        "abstract": "Flow cytometry is widely used in medicine for hematology, immunology, chemotherapy and pathology, as well as in food and water safety. While present instruments are predominantly used in laboratory environments, there is a growing and unmet need for devices that can be used in point-of-care (PoC) settings. The main impediments to PoC solutions are the fluorescent labels, which require sophisticated sample pre-processing and calibration to reduce background, and optics that are difficult to miniaturize. Label-free approaches such as reported in [1] eliminate this problem but have limited applications due to a lack of specificity. Substituting magnetic labels avoids this limitation and eliminates the need for preprocessing, but present solutions use \u03bcHall sensors [2] or giant-magneto-resistors (GMRs) [3], which are not available in standard CMOS technology. CMOS LC-tank spectrometry [4] is amenable to integration but does not achieve the bandwidth and sensitivity required for flow cytometry. In this paper, we present a magnetic flow cytometer integrated in standard CMOS technology assembled in a single-use microfluidic cartridge that meets all the above-mentioned requirements.",

        "abstract": "Dry active electrodes (AE), i.e., the combination of dry electrodes with in situ amplification, are increasingly used for biopotential measurements in emerging healthcare and lifestyle applications [1]. Compared to gel-based wet electrodes, dry electrodes enable fast set-up time, greater user comfort, and long-term monitoring. AE amplifiers ensure local amplification providing improved robustness to noise interference and cable motion artifacts. However, current AEs have analog outputs requiring powerful analog buffers to drive biopotential signals over measurement cables. Furthermore, analog outputs must be digitized by the back-end (BE) system [2,3]. Besides, parameter mismatch between AEs limits the overall CMRR. CMFB [1] or CMFF [2] helps but comes at the expense of increased number cables between the BE and AEs. These problems significantly increase the overall system complexity and cost.",

        "abstract": "Ultrasound imaging is widely used for medical diagnosis, because it is harmless to the human body and has real-time processing capability. Usually the focusing (beamforming) operation is performed for both TX and RX. The RX focusing is performed by an RX beamformer [1-5], which consists of delay elements and adders. Nowadays, digital beamformers (DBF) are mostly used for conventional ultrasound imaging because of high SNR. Recently, 2D ultrasound transducers have been introduced for 3D imaging. Since the 2D transducer has a huge number of transducer elements (e.g., 9216 for a 72\u00d7128 array), it cannot use DBF because of the huge number of required ADCs and wires inside the probe cable. Therefore, analog beamforming must be performed, at least at the front stage of the 2D transducer.In this work, where a 2D CMUT array is used, the maximum delay difference among transducer elements is 8\u03bcs with a maximum steering angle of 45\u00b0 and a maximum focal depth of 15cm. The target sampling resolution is 6.25ns (\u03bbc / 53.3) with a carrier frequency of 3MHz. An analog-digital-hybrid architecture and a non-uniform sampling scheme are used for the RX beamformer of this work to achieve the wide dynamic range of delay time and small chip-area. The RX beamformer consists of 8 analog beamformers (ABF) followed by a single DBF, as shown in Fig. 24.8.1. An ABF performs the focusing operation for the input signals of the adjacent 8 channels to generate an analog output signal. The 8 analog output signals from the 8 ABFs are applied to the DBF. The DBF converts the 8 analog input signals into the 8 digital signals, and then performs the focusing operation on the 8 digital signals to generate a digital output signal for every focal point.",

        "abstract": "The recent revolution in handheld computing with high-speed cellular network made mobile processors have multi-cores and powerful 3D graphic engines that support FHD (1920\u00d71080) or even higher resolutions. Consequently, the memory bandwidth requirement has also been increasing, requiring a next-generation mobile DRAM standard. In this paper, we present a power-efficient LPDDR4 SDRAM operating at 3.2Gb/s/pin. Our LPDDR4 DRAM offers 2\u00d7 bandwidth with improved power efficiency over LPDDR3 SDRAM's, due to the 2-channel architecture and low-voltage-swing terminated logic (LVSTL) [1]. Moreover, the supply voltage is further reduced to 1.0V in this work, 0.1V lower than the LPDDR4 standard, for extra power saving.",

        "abstract": "Increasing demand for higher-bandwidth DRAM drive TSV technology development. With the capacity of fine-pitch wide I/O [1], DRAM can be directly integrated on the interposer or host chip and communicate with the memory controller. However, there are many limitations, such as reliability and testability, in developing the technology. It is advantageous to adopt a logic-interface chip between the interposer and stacked-DRAM with thousands of TSV. The logic interface chip in the base level of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) decreases the CIO, repairs the chip-to-chip connection failure, and supports better testability and improves reliability.",

        "abstract": "The demand for high-bandwidth memories is increasing with an increase in the need for high-performance systems. Wide-I/O memory and GDDR5 are two types of high-bandwidth memories. GDDR5 is more compatible than wide I/O for contemporary systems, such as graphics cards and game consoles. The datarate of GDDR5 has reached 7Gb/s/pin. However, the power consumption and cost have increased owing to high-performance-oriented designs, die penalties, and additional test costs. DDR4 is an alternative low-cost memory with high performance in the range of 2.4 to 3.2Gb/s/pin [1]. However it is difficult for DDR4 DRAM to raise the 3.2Gb/s/pin bin portion to lower the cost. In DRAMs, the standby power and self-refresh power are more important than the operating power because DRAMs are mainly in the standby or self-refresh mode in systems. As the operating speed increases, the data window is narrowed, and the jitter increases. Therefore, a duty-cycle corrector (DCC) is employed to increase the data window when the external clock duty cycle is distorted in GDDR5 [2]. The bang-bang jitter caused by the DCC is inevitable even if the external clock duty ratio is exactly 50%. Sometimes the DCC may distort the data window because of an internal DCC offset. This paper presents a GDDR5M (mainstream) memory for graphics cards and a small-outline dual-inline memory module (SO-DIMM). The standby power is managed by the auto-sync mode. Additionally, the architecture of GDDR5M is similar to that of DDR4, and not GDDR5. The error-adaptive DCC can remove the initial duty-cycle offset automatically and remove the bang-bang jitter when the duty cycle of the external clock is not distorted.",

        "abstract": "As the processing power and clock rate of CPUs and GPUs increase, there is a need for increased I/O bandwidth to enable chip-to-chip communication. I/O pin limitations demand faster links at low power to enable integration of high chip-to-chip bandwidth. However, the channel losses and impedance discontinuities increase at high data rates making it difficult to equalize the channel at low power. In this work, we target reliable, differential, bi-directional links at 20 Gb/s over 6\u201d FR4 PCB trace and flip-chip packages with a total loss budget of 20 dB at Nyquist. In a half-duplex link, one TX and RX are connected on each side and the link direction can be turned around by the controller. A link-turnaround latency of <;10 ns is achieved by placing several key circuits on standby when not in use and by designing fast bias circuits. When fast turnaround is not required, the circuits not in use are powered down permanently and the link is reduced to the simplex case. The top-level transceiver architecture is shown. An LC-VCO-based PLL oscillates at 20 GHz and generates quadrature I/Q clocks at 10 GHz. Both TX and RX use a half-rate architecture to optimize power. The clocks are distributed through an on-chip transmission line to 16 I/O lanes arranged in 2 rows. The links are capable of data rates as low as 14 Gb/s to save power when full bandwidth is not required.",

        "abstract": "Peripheral I/O data-rates for PCs and mobile computing platforms continue to scale to meet high-bandwidth applications including high-resolution displays and large-capacity external storage. The bandwidth requirements will soon exceed the data-rates of current standards such as PCI Express and USB. A low-power low-cost serial link is needed for the next-generation peripheral interface that can scale to 32Gb/s per lane. Recent publications have demonstrated 28 to 32Gb/s rates [1-2]. However, the circuit power and channel characteristics are not suitable for mainstream PC and mobile markets. A low-profile connector and cable assembly prototype is developed for these markets, where the link architecture and design are optimized for the channel characteristics. This paper describes a data-rate-scalable 32Gb/s serial link that features a bidirectional transceiver, source-series terminated (SST) 3-tap FFE, a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) with an active inductor, a 6-tap DFE, and clock calibration and adaptation circuitry.",

        "abstract": "The continuing demand for higher bandwidth in serial interconnects has pushed the symbol rate of differential lanes into the high-insertion-loss region of channels. Multi-level signaling such as differential PAM-4 [1] has been used to mitigate the loss of electrical channels by lowering the signal spectrum. Such an approach suffers from lower SNR tolerance as well as higher susceptibility to crosstalk and ISI as compared to differential signaling (DS). Coded differential approaches have been reported [2] to mitigate ISI. Our approach is a generalization of DS in which ternary values are transmitted on an 8-wire bus. The set of transmitted values belongs to a code consisting of 256 code-words called the 8b8w-code (8-bits-on-8-wires) [3]. The specific correlations in the code-words of the 8b8w-code eliminate transmit common-mode and simultaneous switching output (SSO) noise and allow for detection via self-referencing comparators (unlike PAM-4), which provides additional noise immunity. Compared to DS, the 8b8w-code offers twice the throughput at 50% of the line power. Compared to PAM-4, the code offers better SNR (3dB) at 38% of the line power with enhanced tolerance of ISI and lower crosstalk generation. The design and experimental verification of an 8b8w transceiver in 40nm CMOS is described. Transmission is achieved up to 12Gb/s per wire over 55cm of Rogers with up to 15dB loss.",

        "abstract": "A wide range of memory configurations exist in today's high-speed digital systems to meet platform-specific bandwidth, power, capacity, and cost constraints. In the near term, DDR4 and GDDR5 are expected to meet the needs of server, client, graphics and mobile platforms [1]. Differential signaling with high-speed serial I/O enhancements will potentially continue I/O performance scaling for post-DDR4 and future buffered memory solutions. A unified memory interface that can meet the signaling requirements of all these memory standards offers several benefits: reduced cost and design time, greater platform design flexibility, and a smoother transition from DDR4/GDDR5 to a high-speed differential memory interface [2]. This paper presents a dual-mode TX that supports single-ended (SE) 1.2V-DDR4/1.5V-GDDR5 (hereafter referred to as DDR-mode) as well as high-speed differential signaling (hereafter referred to as HSD-mode), which is implemented using only thin-gate-oxide devices in 22nm CMOS. Other key design features include: (a) a DDR4/GDDR5 driver implemented using only active devices (no linearizing resistors), (b) enhanced voltage-mode driver supply regulation, (c) reconfigurable logic to support pre-emphasis in both TX modes, and (d) low-overhead digital clock-calibration techniques based on asynchronous digital sampling (ADS) to improve calibration coverage and accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Future processor I/Os must aggressively improve per-channel data-rates and energy efficiency to meet projected system bandwidth demands. These constraints necessitate the design of ultra-low-power serial-link transmitters that can efficiently incorporate equalization to compensate for channel losses, while enabling fast power-state transitioning to leverage dynamic power scaling. In this work, a scalable-data-rate voltage-mode transmitter is presented that introduces two main innovations. First, an impedance-modulated 2-tap equalizer is adopted that employs analog control of the equalizer taps, thereby obviating output driver segmentation. Second, fast power-state transitioning is achieved using a replica-biased voltage regulator to power the output stages of multiple channels and per-channel injection-locked oscillators (ILO) that can be rapidly disabled. Furthermore, capacitively driven low-swing global clock distribution and automatic phase calibration of the local ILO-generated quarter-rate clocks enables improved energy efficiency with aggressive supply scaling.",

        "abstract": "DDR3 memory interface (I/F) with single-end signals is very sensitive to external environments, such as chip package type and system board design. In order to guarantee the system performance, IP providers often define the package and PCB design constraints to reduce product risks [1]. These design constraints may increase the package size and DDR3 PCB area to cost, increasing the whole system cost. Therefore, our DDR3 memory I/F design addresses this problem, relaxing the external environment requirements, especially relating to power integrity, and achieves 2.667Gb/s operation in a wirebond package and singleside mounted PCB. The difference between double-side and single-side mounted PCB is shown in Fig. 26.6.1. The capacitor on the PCB cannot be mounted directly near the SOC on the back side of PCB. This external environment increases the distance of the current return loop and also increases the inductance of power decouple capacitance equivalently.",

        "abstract": "Wide-voltage-range-operation DSPs bring more versatility to achieve high energy efficiency in mobile applications to increase signal processing complexity and handle a large range of performance specifications. This paper describes a 32b DSP fabricated in 28nm UTBB FDSOI technology [1]. Body-bias-voltage (VBB) scaling from 0V up to \u00b12V (Pwell/Nwell) decreases the DSP core VDDMIN to 397mV and increases clock frequency by +400% at 500mV and +114% at 1.3V. In addition to technology gains, dedicated design features are included to increase frequency over the full VDD range, considering parameter variations. As depicted in Fig. 27.1.1, the 32b datapath VLIW DSP is organized around a MAC dedicated to complex arithmetic and two dedicated operators: a cordic/divider and a compare/select. Data enters the circuit through a serial interface and code is run from a 64\u00d732b register file. It has been shown in [1] that a given operating frequency can be achieved at a lower VDD in UTBB FDSOI compared to bulk by applying a forward-body bias. An additional design step is achieved in this work by (1) increasing the frequency at low VDD thanks to a specific selection and design of standard cells with respect to power vs. performance and (2) dynamically tracking the maximum frequency to cope with variations.",

With efficient hardware speech decoders, client devices can seamlessly transition between cloud-based and local tasks depending on the availability of power and networking. Most previous efforts in hardware speech decoding [1-2] focused primarily on faster decoding rather than low-power devices operating at real-time speed. More recently, [3] demonstrated real-time decoding using 54mW and 82MB/s memory bandwidth, though their architectural optimizations are not easily generalized to the weighted finite-state transducer (WFST) models used by state-of-the-art software decoders. This paper presents a 6mW speech recognition ASIC that uses WFST search networks and performs end-to-end decoding from audio input to text output.",

        "abstract": "Operating circuits in the near-threshold region enables large energy savings. However, such circuits also pose many challenges, such as increased delay, unwanted leakage paths and high sensitivity to variations. Working in advanced nanometer CMOS technologies compromises the robustness of circuits even more due to the increased variability. Nonetheless, these technologies offer higher operating frequencies for ultra-low-voltage circuits. Transitioning to smaller technologies is attractive for digital near-threshold circuits, provided that the impact of the increased variability can be mitigated. Few prior works have considered the design of variation-resilient ultra-low-voltage circuits in CMOS technologies smaller than 65nm. The aim of this work is to design a large system that advances the state-of-the-art by not only reaching very low energy consumption, but also clock frequencies of tens of MHz, while providing high variation resilience. We present a full JPEG encoder fabricated in a 40nm CMOS technology, fully functional down to a supply voltage of 210mV. The JPEG encoder is able to operate at clock frequencies in a range from 5 to 275MHz for supplies from 210 to 550mV, and thus achieves very high ultra-low-voltage speed. At the minimum-energy point (MEP), the JPEG encoder consumes only 29.01pJ/pixel at an operating frequency of 41MHz (VDD=330mV). The variation (\u03c3/\u03bc) of 26 dies at this point is only 9.4% for the frequency and 6.0% for the energy consumption.",

ASIC implementations of such FFTs are challenging due to their large silicon area and high power consumption. However, the signals in these applications are sparse, i.e., the energy at the output of the FFT/IFFT is concentrated at a limited number of frequencies and with zero/negligible energy at most frequencies. Recent advances in signal processing have shown that, for such sparse signals, a new algorithm called the sparse FFT (sFFT) can compute the Fourier transform more efficiently than traditional FFTs [1].",

        "abstract": "Following the rapid expansion of mobile computing in the past decade, mobile system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs have off-loaded most compute-intensive tasks to dedicated accelerators to improve energy efficiency. An increasing number of accelerators in power-limited SoCs results in large regions of \u201cdark silicon.\u201d Such accelerators lack flexibility, thus any design change requires a SoC re-spin, significantly impacting cost and timeline. To address the need for efficiency and flexibility, this work presents a multi-granularity FPGA suitable for mobile computing. Occupying 20.5mm2 in 40nm CMOS, the chip incorporates 2,760 fine-grained configurable logic blocks (CLBs) with 11,040 6-input look-up-tables (LUTs) for random logic, basic arithmetic, shift registers, and distributed memories, 42 medium-grained 48b DSP processors for MAC and SIMD operations, 16 32K\u00d71b to 512\u00d772b reconfigurable block RAMs, and 2 coarsegrained kernels: a 64-8192-point fast Fourier transform (FFT) processor and a 16-core universal DSP (UDSP) for software-defined radio (SDR). Using a mixradix hierarchical interconnect, the chip achieves a 4\u00d7 interconnect area reduction over commercial FPGAs for comparable connectivity, reducing overall area and leakage by 2.5\u00d7, and delivering a 10-50% lower active power. With coarse-grained kernels, the chip's energy efficiency reaches within 4-5\u00d7 of ASIC designs.",

The chip has been fabricated in a 65nm CMOS process and relies on 16 integrated inductors to achieve energy-efficient operation by recovering charge from gate fanouts. When self-oscillating at 821MHz, the chip recovers 51.4% of the energy supplied to it. In terms of device count, this chip is more than an order of magnitude larger than the largest previously-reported chips with charge-recovery logic [3-4]. When operating at 821MHz, it achieves a 7.9Gb/s throughput at 7.3pJ/b/iteration, improving on results in [1-2,5] by at least 1.7\u00d7 in energy efficiency and 2.3\u00d7 in area efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes in modern wireless communications are rate- and throughput-scalable, and despite their complexity, decoding them requires low power consumption. The IEEE 802.11ad standard for Gb/s wireless LANs in the 60GHz band requires an implementation of an LDPC encoder/decoder with throughputs of 1.5, 3, and 6Gb/s, with code rates of 1/2, 5/8, 3/4 and 13/16 [1]. Previous implementations of decoders for these throughputs and levels of reconfiguration have power consumptions on the order of the rest of the baseband processing [2,3]. This paper presents a fully compatible IEEE 802.11ad LDPC decoder in 28nm ultra-thin body and BOX fully-depleted SOI (UTBB FDSOI) technology with a power consumption that is a small fraction of the total baseband power. To achieve this, the decoder introduces an approximate marginalization technique and a simplified reconfiguration method. Forward body biasing of FDSOI technology allows for minimum energy consumption across all decoding modes.",

        "abstract": "Near-threshold computing (NTC) is an attractive solution to stagnating energy efficiencies in digital integrated circuits, arising from slowed voltage scaling in nanometer CMOS [1-2]. The design of sequential elements for NTC, as well as in voltage-scaled systems operating at both near-threshold and super-threshold, has not been extensively studied. However, it is well known that sequential elements have a strong sensitivity to process variations in NTC [2], which can have a significant impact on system yield and power consumption. In order to achieve reliable energy-efficient operation across a wide operating voltage range, a flip-flop should have the following attributes: 1) static operation, since dynamic nodes are highly susceptible to PVT variations at low voltage; 2) contention-free transitions, since ratioed logic has poor robustness across the wide range of device ION/IOFF ratios incurred with voltage scaling; 3) single-phase clocking, which avoids toggling of internal clock inverters and the corresponding power penalty; 4) minimum or no area penalty compared to conventional flip-flops.",

        "abstract": "The software-defined radio paradigm calls for increasingly digital-intensive programmable receivers, ideally placing the analog-to-digital converter (ADC) right at the antenna. Such an RF ADC should be tunable over several GHz, have programmable gain, low noise, be blocker-tolerant, and consume minimal power. As an attempt to satisfy these requirements, delta-sigma (\u0394\u03a3) modulation close to the antenna interface has been proposed in both bandpass [1], [2] and downconverting [3], [4] configurations. The latter technique enables simpler GHz-range wideband (WB) operation with low power consumption, but such receivers navigate a tradeoff between sensitivity and blocker toleration. The narrowband (NB) direct \u0394\u03a3 structure introduced in [3] combined RF N-path filtering, upconverted \u0394\u03a3 RF feedback, and a second RF gain stage to obtain acceptable noise and linearity simultaneously. In this paper we present a WB direct \u0394\u03a3 receiver, designed for programmable, inductorless operation in the long-term evolution (LTE) frequency division duplexing bands from 0.7 to 2.7GHz. The 40nm CMOS circuit uses a supply of 1.1V and provides RF channel bandwidths up to 20MHz, 37dB maximum gain, NF of 5.9 to 8.8dB, and \u22122dBm IIP3. A design strategy that emphasizes \u0394\u03a3 coefficient programmability ensures good performance throughout the frequency range.",

        "abstract": "Conventional analog PLLs do not scale well with process when compared to alldigital PLLs due to several substantial building blocks such as the loop filter and charge pump (CP). To achieve the required phase noise, the in-band noise is typically suppressed by increasing CP current and loop filter size, while the out-of-band noise is reduced by improving VCO tank Q; both lead to increased die area. This paper presents a fractional-N synthesizer targeting the relatively stringent phase noise requirement to support 256-QAM and MIMO in 802.11ac. It deploys the following techniques to simultaneously address requirements of compact area, low noise and fast calibration: reuse of VCO inductor area for the loop filter; a PFD and CP design that relaxes CP design constraints without sacrificing noise; inductor-less LO generation for 802.11bgn mode; and an area-efficient reference clock doubler and associated calibration scheme. The synthesizer block diagram is shown in Fig. 28.2.1. In 802.11ac/a mode a frequency tripler followed by I/Q dividers realizes the 3/2 frequency multiplication and I/Q generation. In 802.11bgn mode, an LO generation circuit performs the 2/3 frequency multiplication and I/Q generation. This frequency plan features overlapping VCO tuning ranges between 802.11ac/a (FLO=4915\u223c5825MHz) and 802.11bgn (FLO=2412\u223c2484MHz) modes, such that the VCO designed for 802.11ac/a can support 802.11bgn without additional tuning range.",

Impulse radar sends signals with short duration and spreads signal power over a large bandwidth. Favorable features of impulse radar are minor interference with other wireless systems as well as high immunity to nearby radio signals. Thus, impulse radars are compatible with the harsh environments where intensive radio services are operating. In conjunction with the advantages of high integration and low cost in mass production from CMOS technology, more ubiquitous utilizations are feasible for CMOS impulse radars.",

        "abstract": "Conventional continuous-time delta-sigma modulator (CTDSM) architectures do not allow independent control of the shape and bandwidth of the signal transfer function (STF), since the STF is simply a by-product of NTF synthesis. This is particularly troublesome when the input to the CTDSM consists of large out-of-band interferers; handling them without saturating the quantizer needs larger inband DR, leading to increased power dissipation. A solution to this problem is to use a filter upfront to attenuate interferers. Alternatively [1], the filter can be moved into the CTDSM loop. In [1], a 1st-order RC filter was used to \u201ctame\u201d the STF peak of a cascade of integrators with feedforward summation (CIFF) DSM. Apart from the limited selectivity offered by a 1st-order filter, an active feedback path was necessary to stabilize the loop. The CTDSM in our work obtains an STF with a sharper transition band and a lower cutoff frequency (normalized to the desired signal bandwidth) compared to [1], with the aim of more effectively attenuating close-in interferers. This is realized by embedding a 2nd-order active filter into the CTDSM. We show that this has the same functionality as the filter upfront, but achieves better linearity (for the same noise and power dissipation) when compared to the filter-CTDSM cascade. Further, no extra active circuitry is necessary to stabilize the loop. Measurements of a CTDSM (signal BW=2MHz), with a built-in VGA (0 to 18dB) and a 2nd-order Butterworth filter (4MHz cutoff), show that the out-of-band IIP3 improves by about 10dB when compared to the CTDSM with the filter placed upfront. The filtering CTDSM+VGA, which uses a single-bit quantizer and a 4-tap FIR DAC, achieves a DR of 92dB in a 2MHz BW while consuming 5mW in a 0.13\u03bcm CMOS process. The peak instantaneous DR/SNR/SNDR are 82/80.5/74.5dB. With the VGA, the DR is 92dB.",

        "abstract": "The trend for ADCs in wireless communication infrastructure is increased bandwidth with little or no relaxation in noise density or power consumption. The historical expectation of system designers is a noise spectral density (NSD) of -157dBFS/Hz with a power consumption of 0.5W. This expectation is a difficult one to meet with existing ADC architectures when the system bandwidth is 100MHz as demanded by standards such as LTE-A. The 0-3 continuous-time (CT) MASH [1-2] ADC described in this paper allows a direct-conversion receiver with the requisite bandwidth to be constructed, with 10dB lower noise than established benchmarks.",

An effective dithering technique is embedded in the calibration signal to break the dependence of the calibration on the input signal amplitude. In addition, to improve the sampling linearity, the ADC employs input distortion cancellation and another digital calibration to compensate for the non-linear charge injection (kickback) from the sampling capacitors on the input driver. The ADC is fabricated in a 65nm CMOS process and has an integrated input buffer. With a 140MHz and 2Vpp input signal, the SNR is 69dB, the SFDR is 86dB, and the power is 1.2W.",

The n-type transistors are based on a solution-processed n-type metal-oxide semiconductor, and the p-type transistors use an organic semiconductor. As compared to previous work utilizing unipolar logic gates [1], the higher mobility n-type semiconductor and the use of complementary logic allow for a >50x speed improvement. It also adds robustness to the design, which allowed for a more complex and complete standard cell library. The microprocessor consists of two parts, a processor core chip and an instruction generator. The instructions are stored in a Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) memory formatted by a post-fabrication inkjet printing step, called Print-Programmable Read-Only Memory (P2ROM). The entire processing was performed at temperatures compatible with plastic foil substrates, i.e., at or below 250\u00b0C [2].",

        "abstract": "The efficiency of small-molecule OLED devices increased substantially in recent years, creating opportunities for power-efficient displays, as only light is generated proportional to the subpixel intensity. However, current active matrix OLED (AMOLED) displays on foil do not validate this power-efficient advantage, as too much power is lost in the AM backplane. AMOLED displays use the analog voltage on the gate of a drive transistor (e.g. M1 in Fig. 30.2.1) to control the pixel current and hence the pixel brightness. Accurate and uniform pixel currents can only be obtained when transistor M1 is driven is saturation. In highresolution technologies on foil, transistor parameters W, L and the mobility \u03bc are limited by technology, imposing a minimal VGS-VT to obtain sufficient current, i.e. VGS-VT > 4V for a-IGZO on foil [1]. Subsequently, to obtain saturation, VDS > 4V, which translates in a static backplane power loss surpassing the OLED power consumption (see red stars in Fig 30.2.1). However, when the OLED pixel impedance around a specific reference current can be matched along a display column line, the accurate pixel current control can be imposed by current DACs implemented in external silicon display column drivers. In this work, we operate M1 as a switch and pixel intensity variations are obtained using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) of a predefined pixel current, i.e. 2\u03bcA/pixel [80\u221780\u03bcm2] (which corresponds in our OLED technology to a light output of 2000Cd/m2). When, in a future implementation the external DACs are calibrated at 0.2\u03bcA/pixel, the full brightness would correspond to the typical display brightness of a portable PC, i.e. 200Cd/m2. This concept enables us to reduce the display power voltage at full brightness from 8.2V in a classical AMOLED display on foil configuration to 5V (measured) and for future implementations even down to 4V (see Fig. 30.2.1). As the OLED current load remains equal, a corresponding static power reduction of the display (and increased battery lifetime) is obtained. Digital driving methods of AMOLED displays have been shown before. However, \u0394\u03a3 techniques [2] still integrate charge packets on the gate of M1 and hence do not solve the power issue on foil. Other PWM techniques [3] activate only a single active line in the linedriver yielding difficulties to obtain color depths above 6 bits. When multiple independent linedrivers are implemented and their output is multiplexed to alternately drive a single select line, a higher color depth can be obtained [4]. This leads however to a bulky linedriver, which is hard to get within an e.g. 80\u03bcm pitch. The design and implementation of a compact integrated linedriver on foil enabling multiple alternating active signals through a single shift register is demonstrated here.",

        "abstract": "A wet sensor, which detects the presence or absence of liquid, is an important tool for biomedical, nursing-care, and elderly-care applications such as the detection of blood in bandages, sweat in underwear, and urination in diapers. A wet sensor should be a thin, mechanically flexible, large-area, and low-cost device with wireless power and data transmission, because constant monitoring with a rigid and wired wet sensor placed on human skin is annoying. Moreover, the wet sensor should be disposable from a hygiene perspective. In order to meet these requirements, an organic transistor based flexible wet sensor sheet (FWSS) with wireless power and data transmission using 13.56MHz magnetic resonance is developed to detect urination in diapers.",

        "abstract": "In the last several years, organic electronics have gained increasing consideration as a cost-effective alternative to silicon, especially in RFID applications. An inductive-coupled organic RFID operating at 13.56MHz was demonstrated on foil using p-type organic technologies [1]. A complementary organic technology was used for a 13.56MHz transponder in [2]. Recently, a complementary hybrid organic/metal-oxide process was exploited to demonstrate bidirectional communication in an HF RFID [3]. It adopts passive envelope detection using traditional diode-based schemes with OOK modulation. However, OOK modulation usually reduces sensitivity and reading range. In this work, a complementary organic TFT (C-OTFT) technology [4] is used for the first time to implement a 13.56MHz RX front-end, which exploits an active detection scheme and is able to demodulate ASK PWM-coded signals with modulation depth (h) as low as 25%.",

The extremely compact three phase AC-AC matrix converter such as a 25x18mm2 is realized by these GaN/Si integrated chips and novel isolated dividing couplers, which duplicate the gate signal with different references for dual-gate bidirectional switches and reduce gate lines and gate drive components by half. The proposed GaN 3x3 matrix converter is significantly more compact than the conventional one that requires numerous power switches, flywheel diodes, photo-couplers, isolated power supplies and gate drivers.",

Connectors also add to the weight (Fig. 30.6.1(a)). The connectors used in vehicles occupy a considerable space because heavy protection is required against transmission interruption caused by vibration. In addition, a significant number of wires are used together in a junction box to increase total wire length (e.g. 55L when 10 ECUs are connected) and thus weight increases accordingly.",

Following the first generation wearable devices in the form of headsets, shoes and fitness monitors, second generation devices such as smart glasses and watches are making an entrance to the market with a great potential to eventually replace the current mobile device platform eventually (Fig. 30.7.1). Wearable devices can be carried by users in a most natural way and provide all-round connectivity 24-7 without the hassle of stopping all other activities, which enables a totally different mobile experience. For wearable devices, body channel communication (BCC) is an excellent alternative of conventional wireless communication through the air, to obviate the need of high-power transceivers and bulky antennas. However, present BCC transceivers [1]-[5] that mainly target biomedical and sensing applications offer rather limited data rates up to 10Mb/s, which is insufficient in transferring multimedia data for emerging wearable smart devices and content-rich information for high-end medical devices (e.g. multi-channel neural recording microsystems). In this paper, a highly energy-efficient and robust wideband BCC transceiver is presented, which achieves a maximum data rate of 60Mb/s by employing 1) a high input impedance and an equalizer at the RX front-end, 2) transient-detection RX architecture using differentiator-integrator combination coupled with injection-locking-based clock recovery, and 3) 3-level direct digital Walsh-coded signaling at the TX.",

        "abstract": "High-speed track-and-hold amplifier (THA) circuits are critical for high-speed, high-resolution data converters, particularly in emerging 100Gb/s optical communication systems. High-speed CMOS analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) have been demonstrated to 56GS/s, but the linearity tends to rapidly degrade at high frequency. The use of a high-speed THA can broaden the frequency response, improve the distortion performance, and mitigate some of the timing requirements for high-speed time-interleaved ADCs. Recent THA work has leveraged high-fmax Indium Phosphide (InP) HBTs to implement 50GS/s track-and-hold amplifiers. Nonetheless, a two-chip solution consisting of an InP THA and time-interleaved CMOS ADCs is extremely difficult to package while retaining high-speed performance.",

        "abstract": "Direct processing of raw high-dimensional data such as images and video by machine learning systems is impractical both due to prohibitive power consumption and the \u201ccurse of dimensionality,\u201d which makes learning tasks exponentially more difficult as dimension increases. Deep machine learning (DML) mimics the hierarchical presentation of information in the human brain to achieve robust automated feature extraction, reducing the dimension of such data. However, the computational complexity of DML systems limits large-scale implementations in standard digital computers. Custom analog or mixed-mode signal processors have been reported to yield much higher energy efficiency than DSP [1-4], presenting the means of overcoming these limitations. However, the use of volatile digital memory in [1-3] precludes their use in intermittently-powered devices, and the required interfacing and internal A/D/A conversions add power and area overhead. Nonvolatile storage is employed in [4], but the lack of learning capability requires task-specific programming before operation, and precludes online adaptation.",

We can point to great inventions of the past that were accidental, or failed attempts to solve other problems (bugs), as well as those from logical thinking (features). Which is more effective? In this panel, top analog circuit innovators describe the process by which their best innovations were conceived. They give interesting examples, such as turning a bug in the circuit into a feature. Then they argue whether innovation is more effective as a result of accidental discovery or logical thinking. A record of the panel discussion was not made available for publication as part of the conference proceedings.",

Building cost-effective, efficient computing infrastructures is a challenge that starts with technologies that ISSCC knows so well (processors, I/O, memory, etc.), but also encompasses system and customer-centric issues such as cooling, power delivery, and total cost of ownership. An outlook on the future of data centers, including recent trends such as open source models, energy-proportional computing, disaggregation, and software-defined data centers, will be discussed as it pertains to the ISSCC community.",

The intrinsic features of these new devices are lowering the barrier between the analog and the digital worlds, allowing unprecedented performance to be achieved by assisting digital circuits with analog techniques (e.g. body bias) or by assisting analog circuits with digital techniques (e.g. calibration and run-time control). The objective of the forum is to discuss practical design considerations in high-performance scaled CMOS processes, established circuit techniques that take advantage of scaled CMOS process technology in analog, digital, RF and SoC designs, and an outlook for the future in the context of challenges and solutions.",

Besides, image sensors featuring 3D stacking of a specialized image sensor layer on the top of a deep submicron digital CMOS have just come to the market. The objective of this forum is to present applications and details of process integration, device techniques, circuits and system featuring 3D stacking integration. This will start with an overview of 3D stacking ICs, followed by a system perspective with scaling the memory wall. The next two talks will discuss challanges for power reduction with wide memory bandwidth, and performance gains through advanced packaging and chip stacking. This is followed by two talks covering challenges for foundry-specific issues and impact on device performance. The last two talks highlight how to integrate an imaging device on an SoC layer: technical issues and phenomenon of 3D stacked image sensor products, and evolution of 3D integration for imaging systems.",

        "abstract": "Silicon technology continues to shrink, allowing a greater density of devices per unit area. At the same time, process and chip variations increase, making it more difficult to build power-efficient, functional chips. We first review the physical issues that are driving such increasing variation. Then, we look at state-of-the-art approaches to adapt to this variation. Voltage management is a key element, both in innovative management circuits, as well as in integration across the hardware/software design stack for adaptive control of the system. Leveraging error tolerance, where available, is as critical as building new memories that can avoid or mitigate sensitivity to variation. Finally, innovative models to predict the effects of variations are critical to guiding choices in the design process.",

        "abstract": "Sensor node systems are expected to be a major growth field for semiconductor markets, and will connect to the cloud in a future cyber physical world. Wireless sensor networks (WSN) face multiple challenges from system design to low-power electronics and energy sources. Ultra-low-power radios are key elements in such systems, putting high demand on energy efficiency in different modes of operation (active, wake-up and sleep). This forum presents system perspectives and practical design aspects in various energy-efficient and short-range radio circuits and systems, including an introduction to various applications and their requirements for RF and digital signal processing in WSN systems. The technologies range from RF to digital signal processing and algorithms to give comprehensive understanding of recent advances. The forum begins with two high-level design talks on low power radio SoCs. The following four talks present ultra-low-power transceivers for body-area networks, sensor nodes, and health-monitoring applications. The last two talks cover efficient power management and emerging compression methodologies.",

        "abstract": "System power consumption will drive the architecture of future computing systems. From cloud-connected smart phones to the first exaFLOP supercomputers, systems that are the best at managing and minimizing power consumption will hold a key competitive advantage. At the same time, wireline communication bandwidth requirements within these systems will continue to grow exponentially, driving per-lane data rates beyond 25Gb/s and aggregate bandwidth past 1Tb/s while demanding dramatically improved energy efficiency. The objective of this Forum is to provide an overview of ultra-efficient parallel and serial interfaces, advanced memory applications, dense and high-speed optical communication, and platform-driven wired I/O for mobile. The Forum begins with two talks describing how innovative packaging and form factors along with co-design of I/O circuits and interconnects can improve the power/performance tradeoff by more than an order of magnitude. The next two talks address how memory I/O is adapting to meet the aggressive bandwidth and power requirements for systems ranging from cell phones to supercomputers. The next talk explores how to design serial I/O specifically for mobile products, including low-power equalization and clocking and low-latency standby states. The following talk also focuses on energy-efficient clocking and equalization, but explores analog and digital design options for very high-speed link standards. The final two talks highlight recent advances in both discrete and integrated optical transceivers and the power, performance, density and cost benefits for optical in high-performance computing systems.",

Techniques to reduce the power consumed by the sophisticated equalization and clocking circuits necessary to operate over lossy electrical channels are therefore required. This session includes 9 papers in this area, addressing topics of 28Gb/s transceivers, a 60Gb/s transmitter, sub-250fJ/b equalizers at 16 to 25Gb/s, and robust TX equalization and clock generation/recovery designs.",

While architectural innovation has allowed most of the transceiver blocks to be integrated in a single chip, full compliance to wireless standards still demands that many off-chip components be added to achieve the overall solution. The papers presented in this session focus on increasing the level of integration of several key building blocks of wireless transceivers. The first part of the session is focused on the transmitter side and in particular on several closed-loop techniques to maximize the output power delivered to the antenna. The second part of the session gives an overview of the most recent techniques applied to the receiver path. Three wideband solutions are presented, followed by a state-of-the-art tuner and a novel beam-forming receiver.",

        "abstract": "Cloud computing requires interconnect solutions for distances ranging from tens of kilometers to less than one meter, driving the demand for advances in both optical links and copper-based Ethernet PHYs. The power consumption, cost, data-rate, and density of these designs must all be improved simultaneously, driving innovation in both the circuit and system architectures. This session includes 9 papers, including demonstrations of a highly parallel short-reach 60\u00d710Gb/s optical interconnect, linear as well as non-linear techniques for electronic dispersion compensation of optical-component non-idealities at 6 to 25Gb/s, and a driver enabling a VCSEL rated for 25Gb/s to operate at 40Gb/s. Similarly, a new 10GBASE-T analog front-end and a GPHY driver architecture with rail-to-rail full-duplex operation demonstrate power savings for Ethernet PHY applications. Finally, two new CDR architectures enable robust frequency acquisition and low-jitter clock recovery in reference-less systems.",

To minimize standby-power, NEC introduces a 16b MTJ-based non-volatile microcontroller with low wakeup time among NV SoCs.

The next paper is about a flow cytometer-on-a-chip using magnetic bead labels. The seventh paper describes an interface chip for EEG recording with active dry electrodes. Finally, a 64-channel interface chip is presented for beamforming in 2D capacitive micromachined ultrasound transducers (CMUT).",

Next, the first High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) with 4 TSV stacked layers achieving 128GB/s bandwidth is disclosed. Also, new circuits to reduce standby and I/O power in GDDR5M are shown. The papers in this session present the latest technologies and circuit techniques to improve the performance and power in DRAMs.",

This year, however, as the economic situation persists, we continue to provide a reduced-featured Digest, in which the continuation pages (typically including a micrograph and occasionally summary data) have been eliminated from the print version (only), but are available in the Digest download and in IEEE Xplore. Both to reduce cost and to be more-green, we continue to use partially recycled paper along with a just-in-time printing process.",
