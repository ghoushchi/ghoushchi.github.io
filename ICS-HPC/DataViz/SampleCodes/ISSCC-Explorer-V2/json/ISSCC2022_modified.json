        "abstract": "This paper presents an inverter-based 4-tap addition-only feed forward equalization (FFE) transmitter (TX) for compact and power-efficient single-ended memory interfaces. Area and power efficiencies of I/Os are increasingly important as I/Os are becoming faster, more complex, and larger; whereas, the area and power budget is limited. Source-series termination (SST) drivers, which are widely used in FFE TXs, provide good linearity and good impedance matching; however, the linear resistors occupy too much area and add significant parasitic capacitance, thereby dissipating additional power [1] (Fig. 28.4.1). On the other hand, inverters occupy a small area and are power-efficient, but matching their impedance and controlling their output voltage is difficult due to their nonlinear behavior. For example, replacing SST drivers in a conventional FFE (C-FFE) with inverters results in the pull-up PMOSs and pull-down NMOSs to turn on simultaneously during FFE tap subtraction. In this case, the output voltage is not well defined, since it is sensitive to supply noise, mismatch, and process variation. To overcome these issues, a 4-tap addition-only FFE (A-FFE) is proposed: it improves area, power consumption, and the resulting voltage swing, as well as its robustness to coefficient errors (Fig. 28.4.1).",

In payment card applications, using biometrics is of primary interest because it makes the cardholder verification method (CVM) simpler with a higher level of security. Instead of personal identification numbers (PINs) or signatures, individual and unique physical information is applied in the payment procedure. Among several biometric alternatives, the use of fingerprint recognition is becoming the most popular method in plastic smart card applications, because of user convenience and compatibility with the current payment infrastructure without modifications or additional devices [1].",

        "abstract": "Digital beamforming receivers (RXs) support MIMO operation and offer great flexibility and accuracy in multi-beam formation and calibration. However, compared with analog phased-array and hybrid systems, due to the absence of any rejection for spatial in-band blockers, the $\\text{RX}/\\text{ADC}$ dynamic range and linearity should be high enough to prevent array saturation. Therefore, the use of self-steering spatial notch filters (SNFs) is necessary to aid the digital beamformers and reduce RX/ADC power consumption while strong blockers exist. To address that, the sub-6GHz RXs in [1], [2] synthesize a baseband spatial notch impedance and translate it to RF by passive mixers. However, this technique cannot be directly applied at mm-wave frequencies as the impedance translational performance of the passive mixers degrades significantly. Hence, the mm-wave beamformer in [3] realizes a cascadable SNF at an intermediate frequency (IF). However, the front-end mm-wave components like mixers and phase shifters have to tolerate strong blockers, thus degrading RX linearity. Besides, it uses multiple IF buffers and VGAs for signal scaling and combining, which could be power-hungry if a similar method is adopted to realize a mm-wave SNF. To improve on those limitations, we propose a scalable SNF structure, which (1) suppresses the strongest in-band blocker at mm-wave frequencies, (2) supports N-input-N-output MIMOs, and (3) requires no active blocks except the phase shifters. A two-step autonomous notch-steering technique is also developed to adjust the SNF notch direction power-efficiently and accurately.",

High-performance is the key enabler for 4b/cell NAND Flash to enter mainstream systems. This work delivers a 60MB/s programming throughput and a 65\u03bcs tR with an 8kB central WL stair architecture and contact-through-WL (CTW) region. 2.4Gb/s I/O speed is achieved with LTT and CTT combo drivers. A 45% reduction in the read and write data transfer energy is achieved by employing VCCQ domain design. A time-division peak-power-management (TD-PPM) feature effectively reduces system peak power while maximizing system performance. Cache DFT and I/O DFT functions enable a high-speed testing methodology at wafer level. These features are summarized and compared to previously reported 4b/cell Flash memories in Fig. 7.1.1.",

        "abstract": "In mobile SoC, clock sources such as PLLs, are expensive resources both in terms of area and power, and they are commonly shared by multiple clock consumers. To that end, the latest SoCs hold tens of PLLs and hundreds of MUXes and dividers to provide clocks to thousands of clock consumers spread across the entire die area. Yet mobile computing environments tend to utilize only a small fraction of available circuits at one moment. In that sense, proper management of toggling activity on unused clock nets is considered as one of the key power reduction strategies in the mobile world. This is especially true considering long travel distances required for clock distribution from relatively small number of sources. This new environment asks for different approaches compared to traditional ones [1, 2], which are targeted for environments where large volumes of homogeneous circuits are running in parallel. Circuit-level techniques such as resonant clock schemes and adiabatic clock drivers [3, 4] also provide power reduction opportunities, but micro-architectural support of aggressive clock gating can bring additional benefits. Compared to similar approaches [5, 6] in the past, the proposed structure brings additional benefits with clock-selection optimization for clock MUXes, automatic PLL on/off control, complete transparency to S/W, and support for recursive configuration.",

        "abstract": "Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors have become one of the key building blocks to realize metaverse applications with VR/AR in mobile devices and level-5 automotive vehicles. In particular, SPAD-based direct time-of-flight (D-ToF) sensors have emerged as LiDAR sensors because they offer a longer maximum detectable range and higher background light immunity than indirect time-of-flight (I-ToF) sensors with photon-mixing devices [1]. However, their complicated front- and back-end blocks to resolve ToF values as short as 100ps require high-resolution TDCs and several memories, limiting the spatial resolution and the depth accuracy in short ranges. To address this issue, alternative architectures combining both D-ToF and I-ToF techniques have been reported [2, 3]. Direct-indirect-mixed frame synthesis provides accurate depth information by detecting phases in short ranges while creating a sparse depth map with counting photons in long ranges [2]. A two-step histogramming TDC is used in [3] where a coarse D-ToF discriminates distance roughly and a fine I-ToF extracts depth precisely. However, these approaches still suffer from limited depth accuracy [2] or low spatial resolution [3].",

        "abstract": "Low arterial blood oxygenation (SpO2) is a measure of hypoxemia and a sign of problems relating to breathing and circulation. Progressive drop in arterial SpO2 can be an early indicator of severe disease in COVID-19 patients [1]. A hypoxic state can occur rapidly and without a patient's knowledge; therefore, early detection of SpO2 decline can be lifesaving. In other respiratory system diseases such as COPD and sleep apnea, continuously monitoring of SpO2 with a pulse oximeter can enable timely diagnosis of oxygen desaturation. SpO2 is measured with Photoplethysmography (PPG) that uses a photodetector (PD) to detect either the transmission or reflection of light from the surface of the skin at two different light wavelengths. Commercial fingertip SpO2 sensors are not designed for chronic wear and require user intervention to trigger measurements. Alternatively, wearable SpO2 recording devices in the form of watches and rings can operate in the background with minimal user intervention. However, continuous acquisition of SpO2 can present a significant power burden to a wearable device since high-power LEDs must be powered on for each sample, dominating the power dissipation of the sensor. We present a low-power pulse oximeter sensor IC that utilizes sparse sampling to reduce the overall power by 70%.",

        "abstract": "The history of computers was driven by maximizing computing power. In just about thirty years, CPU performance has skyrocketed by 5, 000 times [1], taking computers from the level of an almost mechanical calculator to a gadget to run 3D games. This boost was mainly due to the exponential development of process technology under Moore's Law [2]. While this progress also applies to the mobile world, current CPUs in mobile phones are merely comparable to the nervous systems of a jellyfish, not even capable of replicating connectomes [3] of a honeybee. Besides, Moore's Law and Dennard Scaling are already facing their limitations, if not declared is over, widening the gap between endless human imagination and physical computing levels. Despite a number of technical suggestions to tackle this barrier, few papers have managed to capture the essence of its causes and consequences, or to understand that increase in computing power comes from the combined interaction of design and economic factors as well as process technology improvements. This paper takes a general approach to analyze how each area has come to its limitations and review possible suggestions for innovation, to find if there are certain common and general principles under these innovations. Focusing on the law of change hidden in general evolution, we demonstrate how these laws influence the process, design, and economic factors facing limitation, and try to derive the general principles of integration, distribution, and connection.",

By employing these speed enhancement techniques, we have successfully implemented a 9.5Gb/s/pin 16Gb LPDDR5X using a fourth generation 10nm DRAM fabrication technology. This paper also presents a power-efficient LPDDR5X using (1) a non-stacking bank architecture, (2) an offset-calibrated sense amplifier for the global data lines, (3) an extended dynamic voltage and frequency scaling core (DVFSC), (4) a stacked output driver, and (5) a low-power data aligner.",

        "abstract": "Error-corrected quantum computing is expected to require at least 105 to 106 physical qubits. Superconducting transmons, which are promising qubit candidates for scaled quantum computing systems, typically require individually tailored RF pulses in the 4-to-6 GHz range to manipulate their states, so scaling to 106 qubits presents an enormous challenge. Providing a control line for every qubit from room temperature (RT) to the 10mK environment does not appear to be viable for a 106 qubit system due to multiple factors, including RF loss, mechanical congestion, heat load, and connector unreliability. TDM cannot be used to reduce the number of control lines since all of the qubits may need to be activated at once (e.g., during quantum error correction (QEC) cycles). FDM has been proposed but is undesirable because extra tones can give rise to unwanted qubit excitations.",

A 192Gb 12-high 896GB/s HBM3 DRAM is presented for high-performance memories. A 16Gb GDDR6 DRAM for next-generation graphics applications shows a maximum pin speed of 27Gb/s/pin, while a 9.5Gb/s/pin 16Gb LPDDR5X DRAM is introduced for low-power mobile applications. The interface between memory and system chip is crucial, these five papers propose different schemes to improve the energy efficiency, performance, and signal integrity of memory I/O.",

In particular, emerging IoT devices require increasingly small form factors and therefore must consume very low power, all while operating in congested wireless environments with security designed-in from the ground up. Emerging devices also require built-in machine learning capabilities in tiny footprints while consuming low power.",

The CP die size is 530mm2 in 7nm bulk technology [5] [6].The system contains up to 32 CPs in a four-drawer configuration (Fig 2.3.1). Each CP (shown in Fig 2.3.2 die photo) contains 22B transistors, operates at over 5GHz and is comprised of 8 cores, each with a 128KB L1 instruction cache, a 128KB L1 data cache and a 32MB L2 cache. Chip interfaces include 2 PCIe Gen4 interfaces, an M-BUS interface to the other CP on the same DCM and 6 X-BUS interfaces connecting to other CP chips on the drawer.6 out of the 8 CPs in each drawer have an A-Bus connection to the other drawers in the system.",

Qubit control requires microwave signals modulated by baseband arbitrary waveform envelopes, so as to generate 10ns-to-100ns periodic pulsed signals to manipulate the qubit state [1].In order to prevent qubit state dephasing, the carrier should have a precision better than 1.9kHz (rms). The signal noise bandwidth should be limited from above by the qubit operation speed and from below by the echo-period [1]. To ensure scalability, signal sources should be tunable in a wide range, e.g., 3-to-9GHz for superconducting qubits, assuming enough margin to adapt to PVT variations. To address these constraints, a cryo-CMOS class F2, 3 LC-tank voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) was first reported in [1], with a precision of 3.95kHz (rms) at 4.2K and a power consumption of 7-to-19mW with FTR of 5.7-to-7.3 GHz. In [2], a cryo-CMOS 4.4-to-5.3GHz class D/F2 VCO with an automatic common-mode resonance calibration was presented. Both VCOs suffer from the near-carrier phase noise (PN), i.e., flicker noise region, increasing at CT.Although harmonic-rich tanks have been employed in these designs to suppress flicker noise, the 1/f corners were still easily increased from hundreds of kHz at room temperature (RT) to several MHz at CT. The deterioration of 1/f noise for VCOs can cause difficulties in cryo-CMOS PLL designs for quantum interface applications.",

        "abstract": "Micro-power \u0394\u03a3 modulators are suitable for low-bandwidth, high-precision applications, such as smart sensors, biomedical signal processing and battery-powered IoT devices. They achieve high SNR by oversampling and noise shaping, but higher order loops have stability problems. The multistage noise-shaping (MASH) technique solves this problem by realizing a high-order NTF with several low-order stages. However, for the MASH structure to be effective, the loop filter integrators must have high gain to avoid quantization noise leakage. Conventionally, they are realized by high-gain OTAs with gain-boosted cascode [1].However, they draw static bias current, and their biasing and common mode feedback (CMFB) make them unattractive in duty-cycled operation in IoT applications due to the long settling time. The floating-inverter amplifier (FIA) [2] does not require biasing and CMFB, which makes it an attractive option for IoT applications. However, cascade topologies are needed to achieve high gain in [2\u20133], which increases complexity and area since each stage contributes a pole and requires a reservoir capacitor (CRES). An additional CRES is used in the output stage of [3] to optimize the settling performance and stability, which costs further area. This paper presents a dynamic-body-biasing assisted correlated level shifting (CLS) technique to boost the DC gain of a single-stage FIA with only one reservoir capacitor to above 66dB with minimal area overhead. This enables a fully dynamic MASH ADC that consumes 2.87\u03bcW while achieving 96.9dB DR and 94.0dB SNDR in 1kHz BW at an OSR of 125\u00d7, resulting in a SNDR-based Schreier FoM of 179.4dB.",

        "abstract": "To fulfill upcoming communication specifications, it has become popular recently to employ pipelined-SAR architectures, incorporating residue amplifiers (RA) to achieve high resolution, wide bandwidth, and low-power ADCs [1,2]. Hence, the RA design plays an important role in the ADCs. In this work, a distributed averaging correlated level shifting (DACLS) ringamp is proposed to not only enhance the resolution by reducing the RA gain error, but also extend the bandwidth by minimizing the RA output load compared to prior arts [2 \u2013 4]. In addition, a customized bypass-window backend for the last pipeline stage is applied for power reduction.",

        "abstract": "Bitcoin is the leading blockchain-based cryptocurrency used to facilitate peer-to-peer transactions without relying on a centralized clearing house [1]. The conjoined process of transaction validation and currency minting, known as mining, employs the compute-intensive SHA256 double hash as proof-of-work. The one-way property of SHA256 necessitates a brute-force search by sweeping a 32b random input value called nonce. The 232 nonce space search results in energy-intensive pool operations distributed on high-throughput mining systems, executing parallel nonce searches with candidate Merkle roots. Energy-efficient custom ASICs are required for cost-effective mining, where energy costs dominate operational expenses, and the number of hash engines integrated on a single die govern platform cost and peak mining throughput [2]. In this paper, we present BonanzaMine, an energy-efficient mining ASIC fabricated in 7nm CMOS (Fig. 21.3.7), featuring: (i) bitcoin-optimized look-ahead message digest datapath resulting in 33% Cdyn reduction compared to conventional SHA256 digest datapath; (ii) a half-frequency scheduler datapath, reducing sequential and clock power by 33%; (iii) 3-phase latch-based design with stretchable non-overlapping clocks, eliminating min-delay paths; (iv) robust ultra-low-voltage operation at 355mV using board-level voltage-stacking; and (v) mining throughput of 137GHash/s at an energy efficiency of 55J/THash.",

        "abstract": "The rise of the internet-of-things and distributed sensor nodes with machine-learning and edge processing are driving the need for low-power, high-precision ADCs. These highly digital systems are best implemented in advanced process nodes that have low intrinsic gain and low supply voltages, making the design of the high-performance amplifiers required in high-precision delta-sigma (\u0394\u03a3) ADCs challenging. Time-domain ADC architectures, such as voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO)-based ADCs, have been explored to address these challenges as time-domain processing is agnostic to supply voltage and benefits from advanced process nodes with faster switching times [1]. However, linearity has been challenging as open-loop VCO-based ADCs have only ~50dB SFDR. As such, significant research has been devoted to the development of linearization techniques such as feedback [1], mixed-domain operation [2], digital calibration [3], and higher-order noise-shaping using VCO-only architectures [4]. This paper presents a 3rd-order, VCO-only \u0394\u03a3 ADC achieving 92.1dB SNDR over a 2.5kHz bandwidth (BW) using a pseudo virtual ground feedforward (PVG FF) technique. The key concept is to feed forward the pseudo virtual ground in a capacitively coupled VCO-based ADC, which linearizes and stabilizes the system while only using a single feedback DAC. This approach enables a high dynamic range (DR) due to the 3rd-order noise-shaping and >120dB SFDR due to the linearization. The prototype ADC consumes 4.4\u03bcW from a 0.8V supply achieving the best-reported SNDR Schreier figure of merit (FoM) for VCO-based ADCs at 179.6dB.",

        "abstract": "For the battery- or USB-powered portable smart devices, which supply their computing cores with a wide-range sub-volt rail, the energy-efficient high and wide voltage-conversion-ratio (VCR) converters are crucially important. In addition, low form factor and decent transient responses are also favorable for such applications. Prior state-of-the-art designs either use single-stage hybrid designs using multi-level or Dickson converters [1 \u2013 3], or adopt two-stage cascaded architectures with a highly efficient unregulated front (or rear) stage [4], as shown in Fig. 18.6.1 (left). The multi-level designs, which conduct the full inductor current through all the on-state switches, are suited to low-to-medium power levels with limited current density. The Dickson converters take advantage of a high conversion ratio, however, at the cost of reduced output voltage range. The two-stage designs which show decent output range and efficiency, however, can suffer from heavy load efficiency degradation considering that the efficiency of both stages degrade with increasing load and the overall efficiency which is the product of the efficiencies of the two stages is severely degraded. Inspired by the inductive-sigma converter [5] which shunts a highly efficient unregulated LLC with a regulated Buck, this work proposes a reconfigurable capacitive-sigma converter. By input-series and output-shunting a highly efficient unregulated switched-capacitor (SC) converter with a reconfigurable Dickson hybrid Buck stage, the power stage input current is reused and output currents are combined. Therefore, the overall efficiency is greatly improved in a wide continuous VCR range and with an enhanced loading capacity. Besides, as will be demonstrated, the proposed design shows inherently decent load transient and regulation performances.",

        "abstract": "The demand for 100+Gbps data-rates in wireless communications has driven the rapid development of silicon-based transceivers in the mm-wave and sub-THz bands. The broad available spectrum in D-band (110 to 170GHz) is attracting interest for short-range and backhaul high-speed communication [1,2]. To overcome the high path loss, a high-power transmitter (TX) or power amplifier (PA) is essential in such systems. However, silicon-based mm-wave PAs encounter several challenges, such as the limited fT/fmax of transistors, low breakdown voltage in CMOS/SiGe transistors, and the considerable loss of passive networks. Additionally, the widely employed high peak-to-average-power-ratio (PAPR) signal poses severe requirements for TXs/PAs, including peak efficiency and power back-off (PBO) efficiency. A solution to these challenges is proposed in this work and resulted in a D-band PA with >22dBm saturated output power (PSAT) and >10% PBO efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Low electromagnetic interference (EMI) is essential for isolated DC-DC converters that are used in the harsh industrial environments. To pass the CISPR 32 Class-B EMI standard, a 4-layer PCB with a stitching capacitor implemented by the internal layers is commonly required [1], which greatly increases the cost of the system and the effort of PCB layout. Therefore, low-cost circuit techniques that can reduce EMI at the source are highly desirable. As shown in Fig. 14.7.1, input-to-output dipole radiation caused by the common-mode (CM) current ICM across the parasitic capacitance CP of the isolation barrier is the predominant mechanism of EMI, and the fluctuation of the CM voltages of the transformer at the primary and the secondary side, VCM_PRI and VCM_SEC, should be suppressed to reduce ICM. VCM_SEC can be kept quiet by adopting a symmetrical full-bridge rectifier in the receiver (RX) side, and thus the amplitude of ICM mainly depends on the fluctuations of VCM_PRI which are determined by the topology of the transmitter (TX). Unfortunately, when using the LC-tank oscillator adopted in [2] and [3], or the leakage-inductance-resonant flyback (LiRF) topology proposed in [4], VCM_PRI suffers from large and quick fluctuations. Frequency hopping technique can be employed to reduce ICM [2], but it will greatly increase the output voltage ripple and the circuit complexity. In [5], an LLCC topology with a multistage pre-driver is proposed to form a more symmetrical structure to reduce ICM. However, a costly magnetic-core micro-transformer and two extra external capacitors are needed.",

        "abstract": "Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have been demonstrated as a ground breaking technology for providing low-cost low-latency global internet access. However, each satellite needs more than 200kg launch mass due to bulky wireless components and solar cells, which raises a serious cost issue. One possible solution is further minimizing satellite mass, such as cube satellites, by realizing an ultra-low-power Kaband phased-array transceiver. In this work, 1W power consumption is targeted for a 256-element Ka-band phased-array receiver, i.e. 4mW per element. In the conventional geostationary communication satellites, a parabolic antenna is utilized, and a transceiver module is placed inside a metallic cavity so it can tolerate cosmic radiation. On the other hand, LEO satellites need beam-steering functionality by using a phased-array antenna, and only a thin shield layer can be inserted between antennas and ICs for avoiding redundant mass and insertion loss. Thus, the radiation-hardening and low power consumption are key requirements for such cube satellite phased arrays. For RF building blocks in a phased array, the total ionizing dose (TID) is more critical than the single event effects (SEE). Figure 4.8.1 shows an estimated result for non-radiation-hardened design regarding TID degradation on beam pattern, resulting in 3.8dB main-lobe degradation. In this work, 2.7Mrad TID tolerance is considered adequate for a 3-year lifespan with a 24pm PCB copper shield. Figure 4.8.1 also summarizes the system requirements for a phased-array satellite receiver.",

        "abstract": "The IoT crucially requires a large number of low-cost and low-power wireless sensor nodes. BLE is a strong candidate for their wireless interface. Much effort has been made in prior BLE transceivers to reduce power consumption by employing Sliding-IF (SIF) architecture in RX [1,3,4,6] or the stacked LO buffer in Low-IF architecture [2]. However, prior arts cannot realize low power and small area at the same time. As the SIF architecture needs RF notch filters to suppress image response, it requires multiple on-chip inductors resulting in large area. On the other hand, the Low-IF architecture requires IQ mismatch calibration in the production test to meet a requirement of image frequency interference (C/Iimage) [2]. The IQ calibration needs an analog phase adjuster, a power detector, and a digital algorithm, suffering from area overhead. Another effort on BLE transceivers is implementing antenna impedance-matching circuits on a chip to reduce BOM cost [1,2]. Previous on-chip matching circuits aimed at \u201czero\u201d external components are limited to 50O antennas only. However, the antenna impedance is not always 50\u03a9, such as a monopole antenna with poor ground design. Thus, tunability of the impedance matching is needed to adjust the impedance to 50\u03a9. The previous work has certain impedance tunability [3], but it sacrifices RX NF. This work presents Self IQ-phase Correction (SIQC), which does not need IQ calibration, and an on-chip Antenna Impedance Tuner (AIT) with inductive coupling providing a wide tuning range and better RX NF.",

        "abstract": "A high-performance clock generator with extremely low jitter, area, and power consumption is the key building block in the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) to connect billions of devices. Recently, digital phase-locked loops (DPLL) [1,2] have been developed to eliminate the bulky loop filter (LF) in type-II charge-pump PLLs. However, they suffer from quantization noise and spurs, requiring complex calibration techniques. Therefore, type-I reference-sampling PLLs are gaining popularity [3, 4] to achieve wider bandwidths in smaller areas. A passive sampling phase detector (SPD) has a much lower noise contribution than a charge pump. But, a fractional-N implementation requires a digital-to-time converter (DTC) to align the input clocks of the SPD for spur mitigation [3]. Precise gain and nonlinearity calibrations are needed as the DTC delay can vary significantly with process-voltage-temperature (PVT) variations. This increases the complexity and loop convergence time, which are not preferable for IoT applications. A capacitive digital-to-analog-converter (CDAC)-based approach proposed in [4] relies on an accurate voltage reference provided externally, which also requires a calibration across PVT in practical implementations. This work presents a voltage-interpolation (VI) technique based on the capacitor charge sharing in a type-I sampling PLL to achieve the fractional-N operation and, therefore, eliminate a DTC or voltage reference and the associated complex calibration logic, providing fast phase locking. Furthermore, noise is minimized using a passive switch-capacitor-based VI (SC-VI), and the fractional frequency-synthesis resolution is enhanced utilizing a AZ-VI. Moreover, for edge-compute platforms, fast shutdown and restart of the clocking subsystem are necessary for efficient power management by transitioning among different power states. To enable such a requirement, the PLL is reconfigured to inject energy into the crystal for quick startup. Prior energy injection techniques in crystal oscillators for fast startup [5] used a dedicated ring voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO), which exhibited startup time uncertainty due to high jitter and frequency drift across PVT, requiring an additional frequency calibration step. In contrast, reusing the LC VCO inside a PLL that follows the crystal oscillator to perform frequency synthesis introduces less noise and frequency drift for robust startup while eliminating the VCO frequency calibration step. In addition, the chirp mechanism, which is similar to [5], sets the VCO frequency very close to the desired steady-state value, providing faster PLL locking.",

        "abstract": "In a fractional-N PLL, it is beneficial to minimize the input range of its phase detector (PD) as it promotes better linearity and higher PD gain for suppressing noise contributions of the following loop components. This can be done by canceling the predicted instantaneous time offset between the frequency reference (FREF) and the variable oscillator-clock (CKV) edges prior to the PD. There are currently two main cancellation strategies. The first is to align FREF and CKV by inserting a digital-to-time converter (DTC) on either path. However, due to the DTC nonlinearity and its susceptibility to PVT variations, the PLL can suffer from large fractional spurs. Although system-level techniques, e.g., background calibration [1], supply ripple reduction [2], and DTC code randomization [3], can partially alleviate these DTC issues, the overall system complexity worsens. The second method is to convert and cancel the predicted time offset in the voltage domain [4]. This arrangement is less sensitive to PVT variations. However, the accuracy of the time-to-voltage conversion relies on the strict trade-offs between the power consumption, noise, and linearity of a current source. In this work, we introduce a third solution based on a time-mode arithmetic unit (TAU), which outputs a weighted sum of time delays between the (falling) edges of FREF and CKV, as well as between two consecutive CKV edges. Compared with DTC-based solutions, it is less sensitive to PVT variations, as its output merely varies by the ratio of RC time constants, thus ensuring low fractional spurs with no extra system complexity. Compared to the voltage-domain solutions, the absence of a current source is beneficial for phase-noise optimization and migration to more advanced technology nodes. Moreover, TAU can implicitly provide a time-amplification (TA) gain, thus further suppressing the noise of subsequent blocks.",

        "abstract": "Ever since the introduction of high bandwidth memory (HBM DRAM) and its succeeding line-ups, HBM DRAM has been heralded as a prominent solution to tackle the memory wall problem. However, despite continual memory advancements the advent of high-end systems, including supercomputers, hyper-scale data centers and machine learning accelerators, are expediting requirements for higher-performance memory solutions. To accommodate the increasing system-level demands, we introduce HBM3 DRAM, which employs multiple new features and design schemes. Techniques such as an on-die ECC engine, internal NN-DFE I/O signaling, TSV auto-calibration, and layout optimization based on machine-learning algorithms are implemented to efficiently control timing skew margins and SI degradation trade-offs. Furthermore, reduced voltage swings allow for improved memory bandwidth, density, power efficiency and reliability.",

        "abstract": "Data centers continue to require interconnects with higher bandwidth densities and energy efficiencies. Silicon photonics (SiP)-based solutions have gained interest for implementing low-cost and power efficient 100+Gb/s/A optical transceivers. While microring modulators (MRMs) have small footprints and high electro-optical bandwidth (EOBW), they suffer from an inherent tradeoff between bandwidth and optical phase efficiency, high sensitivity to process and temperature variations, and non-linear electro-optic characteristics [1 \u2013 2]. Travelling-wave Mach-Zehnder Modulators (TW-MZMs) require power-hungry drivers to compensate microwave losses and occupy large areas on chip [3 \u2013 4]. Metal-oxide-silicon-capacitor (MOSCAP)-based phase modulators can significantly scale the area and power of the optical transmitter (OTX) owing to their superior optical efficiency (voltage-length product at n phase shift of V\u03c0L < 1Vmm) and compact footprint (< 1mm) [5]. MOSCAP modulators, however, impose large capacitive parasitics (~3fF/\u03bcm), which could limit the electro-optical bandwidth (EOBW) significantly. State-of-the-art wireline transmitters cannot meet the requirements of MOSCAP modulators due to their 50\u03a9-terminated design and limited output voltage swing [6]. This paper presents a 3D-integrated 100Gb/s PAM-4 OTX with electronic pre-distortion (PD) and BW extension techniques to compensate for MOSCAP modulator BW limitations.",

High-order modulation often forces power amplifiers (PAs) to operate at deep power back-off (PBO) (i.e., 12dB or even higher), where typical PAs always suffer from efficiency degradation.

V-Cache expands Zen3's on-die L3 Cache from 32MB to 96MB, providing up to 2TB/s of bandwidth and 15% average gaming performance uplift. This paper describes the hybrid bonding technology components, provides insight into the V-Cache's architecture and design, discusses the associated DFT implications, and offers measured performance results.",

Among these, PDAF is an essential feature of cutting-edge CIS for accurate autofocus at extremely low-light situations, and dual-pixel technology has been widely used for AF of the entire image area [4]. To implement high pixel resolution in a limited optical size, the pixel size has continued to shrink, and the pixel structure has evolved to maintain high image quality. However, for a dual pixel, integrating two photodiodes (PDs) in one pixel by backside deep trench isolation (BDTI) has technical limitations and causes degradation of image AF performance as well as image quality.",

        "abstract": "Noise shaping continues to drive high-DR ADC performance in many applications with kHz bandwidth, including sensor and audio interfaces. The first three \u0394\u03a3 ADC paper in this session reach SNDRs higher than 92 dB and demonstrate significant progress in SFDR (123.2dB), DR (96.9 dB), or compactness and DR (108.8 dB). Noise shaping is also exploited in the two following paper to extend the bandwidth of high DR ADC to 360 MHz with 68dB DR and 120 MHz with 114dB SFDR. The session wraps up with two noise-shaping SAR converters with a new architecture exploited to reduce the OSR to 5, while achieving close to 14 ENOB, and a TI-Pipe-SAR with a bandwidth tunable from 125MHz to 1GHz.",

        "abstract": "Beamforming with multiple microphones is essential for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in earbuds, cell phones, and smart speakers. Although fixed delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming is simple to implement, it only suppresses noise from a fixed direction of arrival (DoA) [1]; hence, it is ineffective in real varying noise conditions. Reference [2] implements ultra-low-power keyword spotting (KWS) with noise suppression, but the lack of an ADC and beamforming limit practical application. On the other hand, adaptive beamforming (ABF) actively adjusts nulls to suppress varying noise sources. Adaptive beamforming with a trained DNN is promising [3] but requires extensive training data and high power consumption and is not applicable for battery-operated systems. Conventional adaptive beamforming [4 \u2013 5] (Fig. 32.5.1) adaptively reduces noise and interference in the output of a fixed DAS beamformer. Although conventional ABF is effective and compact, it is hampered by: 1) high DSP power consumption due to high ADC sampling rate and the need for complex calculations, especially in the blocking matrix (BM); 2) target signal direction errors in DAS cause severe signal distortion; and 3) worst-case input-SNR design causes high ADC and DSP power regardless of actual signal conditions.",

        "abstract": "Recently, there is an increasing demand for better in-band(IB) and out-of-band(OOB) linearity for sub-6GHz applications [1 \u2013 3]. To achieve high linearity, one solution is to utilize current-mode direct conversion [1]. In this architecture, the low-noise amplifier (LNA) acts as a transconductor, which avoids large voltage gain, thus achieving high linearity. Another solution is to employ mixer-first architecture [2,3]. This kind of receiver starts with a passive mixer, which avoids any possible voltage gain brought by the LNA and shows improved tolerance to the blockers. However, unlike the current-mode architecture, its transimpedance-amplifier (TIA) input is not a virtual ground, but a high-impedance node, for input matching purpose [2]. Meanwhile, to achieve better NF, noise-cancellation techniques are widely used in different architectures to improve the noise performance [4,5], achieving sub-1dB NF at 1GHz [4] and 1.75dB NF at 5GHz [5]. However, both receivers are with LNA-first architecture, which limits their linearity.",

To maximize battery life, the acquired data is usually accumulated in SRAM before being transmitted; requiring economic on-chip memory solutions with ultra-low standby power. Artificial-intelligence-of-things (AIoT) based sensing platforms aim to extend this concept further by using on-chip neural networks (NN) to detect valid events at the edge node; further reducing network traffic and overall power consumption by limiting the transmission of invalid events [1]. This edge intelligence has created an ever-increasing demand for on-chip SRAM: high capacity is required to store a large number of weights and accumulated features for accurate decisions; low leakage is critical for data retention as the edge nodes stay in standby for the majority of time; speed is important to deliver timely processing and fast propagation of emergent events; and area, as well as technology availability, are keys to keep the cost down. It is also preferred not to use a dedicated retention mode to eliminate the latency and power overhead of mode switching, which is more frequent when working with light and sparse data traffic in AIoT sensing scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Extensive research on quantum mechanics in past decades has successfully paved the way towards the disruptive technology of quantum computing. A further step to the realization of a fault-tolerant scalable quantum computer is presenting challenges in the field of engineering. It necessitates a microsystem operating at 4K in a dilution refrigerator, which would be inevitable to control thousands or millions of qubits sitting at 10mK. There have been IC implementations of pulse modulators generating qubit-controlling microwave signals [1\u2013 4]. The pulse modulation based on direct synthesis demonstrated feasibility of driving multiple qubits with frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) through one RF cable [1 \u2013 3]. The first implementation of a full controller [1], which includes both read and write chains for spin qubits, demonstrated the highest level of integration. However, the previous work used external local oscillator (LO) sources for frequency synthesis. External feeding of LO requires precise matching; otherwise, a failure would cause leakage to the qubit driving output through PCB traces, resulting in AC-Stark shift of qubit state by unwanted tones at near-resonance. It becomes more problematic in FDM-based multi-qubit driving. Since the fidelity of qubit operations strongly relies on the quality of driving frequency, a low-noise LO generation by a phase-locked loop (PLL) is one of the most important factors [5]. The internal generation of LO gives additional benefits in superconducting qubit interface. It necessitates multiple LOs since the superconducting qubit uses microwave pulse driving for both read and write. To detect the state of a qubit through dispersive readout, the phase reflected from the readout resonator should be measured. Therefore, the driving pulses for the read and the write should be synchronized to a single reference timing. Using built-in PLLs sharing a single reference clock naturally solves this problem.",

        "abstract": "At the center of autonomous driving and range and motion sensing in industrial and healthcare applications are FMCW RADARs, which provide the means for object range and velocity estimation. With future widespread use and availability of more bandwidth for RADAR systems, FMCW generators with short chirp duration and low phase noise will be important to reduce the RADAR doppler-induced range ambiguity and improve its resolution of close targets in multi-target environments. Due to the conflicting tradeoffs between bandwidth and low phase noise, PLLs with two-point modulation (TPM) are commonly used. The TPM architecture suffers from 2 main drawbacks: 1) In analog implementations [1, 2], it requires a low-noise DAC to inject a modulation signal in the sensitive tuning port of the VCO degrading phase noise, 2) Due to the finite matching between the high- and low-pass paths of the PLL, it introduces FM errors, which degrade the linearity of the generated chirps and require calibration. This is true for analog and digital implementations [3]. This work presents a FMCW modulator using an RTWO-based ADPLL to alleviate the phase-noise-versus-settling-time limitations of conventional PLL architectures. It generates sawtooth chirps with slopes up to 65MHz/\u03bcs, 2\u03bcs settling time, 12.5ns chirp retrace time, and 37kHz rms FM error. This is while achieving phase noise of -120dBc/Hz at a 1MHz offset from a 10GHz RF carrier.",

        "abstract": "The profile of portable and wearable devices keeps shrinking, demanding high current density power management integrated circuits. Switched-capacitor (SC) converters and buck converters are two common solutions. Unregulated SC converters can achieve high power density and high efficiency for specific voltage conversion ratios (VCRs). However, to cover wide input and output voltage ranges, they require a reconfigurable topology with multiple VCRs, thus increasing the system complexity. On the other hand, buck converters can reach a good efficiency over a wide continuous VCR range. Yet, they need a bulky inductor, which significantly degrades the power density. To address the power density and efficiency tradeoff, hybrid converters composed of both inductor and capacitor are among popular solutions [1 \u2013 4]. When compared with the traditional buck converter, these hybrid converters feature lower voltage swing (smaller current ripple) of the inductor, higher switching frequency, and a larger duty cycle (D) for the same VCR, alleviating the requirements on the inductor, and resulting in higher power density. Nevertheless, as all the output current IOUT goes through the inductor, this implies a large volume for small DCR and conduction loss ${P_{\\text{COND}}}$_L. Recently, hybrid converters with reduced inductor current IL have emerged [5 \u2013 7]. In these hybrid converters, the SC not only lowers down the voltage of the switch node, but also offers another current path to the output, reducing the inductor current. In this work, we propose an SC-parallel-inductor buck topology (which we refer to as CPL-Buck since in the proposd structure there is a capacitor that is always in parallel with the inductor) that can further reduce /L to less than 0.5IOUT, meaning a PCOND_L reduction of over 75% for the same DCR. Measurement results show that, for 1.2A maximum IOUT, 3-to-4.2V input to 0.6-to-1V output, the proposed CPL-Buck obtains a peak efficiency of 92.9% and a peak current density of 0.3A/mm2 with a power inductor as small as 1.6\u00d70.8\u00d70.8mm3.",

As one of the widest-employed PLL structures, a charge-pump PLL (CPPLL) with a phase-frequency detector (PFD) is known for its excellent robust lock-acquisition performance due to the capability to detect phase and frequency error simultaneously. Recent research exhibited the great potential of the CPPLLs to achieve sub-100fsrms jitter [1]. However, a large current CP is adopted in [1] to minimize CP noise at the cost of high-power consumption. In this work, a 25.8GHz PLL with a time-amplifying phase-frequency detector (TAPFD) is implemented to suppress the CP noise by the high phase-error detection gain of the TAPFD and maintain the robust acquisition ability concurrently. The prototype is measured to achieve 60fsrms jitter and -252.8dB FoMJ.",

Resource constraints such as people per project or the cost of working in the latest technology node also impacts who can participate in cutting edge research. Industry does not have strong incentives to publish their most innovative and competitive work, leaving many in the dark as to what the state of the art is within companies. Even within industry, innovation can come from research, product, or startups. On the academic side, funding bodies and trends can also impact the innovation process. How can we close this gap and who really has the edge? Is industryguided academic research the way to get the best of both worlds? The traditional debate has been between academia and industry, but there are many more facets to the discussion. This panel explores a variety of perspectives of how innovation occurs across the industry.",

        "abstract": "The millimeter-wave (mm-wave) high-speed wireless communication has placed stringent requirements on the phase-noise performance of the local oscillators (LO), especially when a high-order modulation such as 1024-QAM is used. To meet the phase noise requirement, one can use a subharmonic oscillator followed by frequency multipliers to improve the phase noise performance [1]. However, the frequency multipliers and the necessary extra amplification stages consume a large chip area and power. On the other hand, mm-wave fundamental VCOs suffer from the Q drop as inductance becomes too small due to the inner-edge deconstructive coupling in single-turn inductors [2]. To overcome this problem, multicore technologies are used in mm-wave fundamental oscillators [2 \u2013 6]. By coupling N cores together, the phase noise can be improved by 10log(N). At the same time, the inductance in each core can be large for the given phase-noise requirement, thus alleviating the small-inductor problem. The key to a multicore oscillator design is to effectively synchronize each oscillator core. The left top of Fig. 9.3.1 shows the schematic of the resistance-coupled multicore oscillator [3 \u2013 5], where resistors are placed between the corresponding output nodes of each core. The resistance-coupling scheme is good for a small number of cores, such as 2 cores or 4 cores, where the output node of each core can be physically close to each other. In a many-core extension, as shown in the left-middle of Fig. 9.3.1, some of the coupling resistors stretch over a long distance, which increases their parasitic capacitance and contributes to tank mismatch. It also suffers from the trade-off between the lock range and parasitic capacitance. The right top of Fig. 9.3.1 shows the schematic of the proposed transformer-based mode-rejection-coupled multicore oscillator. In this scheme, the oscillator active core shares the transformer tank with its two adjacent cores, and isolation resistors are placed in the middle of gate coils. The resistor damps the Q of the transformer in the common mode, forcing the voltage signals at the two sides of the transformer to be differential, therefore synchronizing the oscillator cores. The transformer-based mode-rejection-coupled scheme has several advantages over the resistance-coupled scheme. First, the isolation resistors are transparent in the differential mode, therefore providing robust coupling without the parasitic capacitance penalty. Second, because the two sides of transformers are connected to two different active cores, they do not have to be physically close to each other, thus enabling the slab type inductors, which can achieve simultaneous small inductance and high Q as in [2]. Third, since the resistors are only placed at local-gate central taps, the transformer-based mode-rejection-coupled scheme is suitable for the many-core extension. Similar mode-rejection-coupled ideas have been used in [2, 6]. Single inductors, instead of transformers, are used in [2], which only applies to CMOS configuration due to the power-supply issue. Triple-coupled-transformers are used in [6], where the source coil is much shorter than the coils at gate and drain terminals, making it difficult to extend to more than 4 cores. In this work, a transformer-based mode-rejection-coupled many-core fundamental oscillator is proposed. A 16-core oscillator is prototyped in a 65nm CMOS process and achieves -136.0dBc/Hz phase noise at a 10MHz offset, 190.3dBc/Hz peak FoM at 10MHz, and a 53.6-to-60.2GHz frequency-tuning range.",

        "abstract": "The increasing amount of dark silicon area in power-limited SoCs makes it attractive to consider reconfigurable architectures that could intelligently repurpose dark silicon. FPGAs are more efficient than CPUs, but lack temporal dynamics of CPUs, efficiency and throughput of accelerators. Coarse-grain reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs) can achieve higher throughput, with substantial energy efficiency gap relative to accelerators, and limited multi-program dynamics. This paper introduces a domain-specific and energy-efficient (within 2-10\u00d7 of accelerators) multi-program runtime-reconfigurable 784-core processor array in 16nm CMOS. Our design maximizes generality for signal processing and linear algebra with minimal area and energy penalty. The main innovation is a statistics-driven multi-layer network which minimizes network delays, and a switch box that maximizes connectivity per hardware cost. The layered network is O(N) with the number of processing elements N, which allows monolithic or multi-dielet scaling. The network features deterministic routing and timing for fast program compile and hardware-resource reallocation, suitable for data-driven attentive processing, including program trace uncertainties and application dynamics. Further, this work demonstrates multiple functional dielets that have been integrated at 10\u03bcm bump pitch to build a monolithic-like scalable design. The multi-dielet (2\u00d72) scaling is enabled by energy-efficient high-bandwidth inter-dielet communication channels that seamlessly extend the intra-die routing network across dielet boundaries, quadrupling the number of computeresources.",

        "abstract": "High speed data links play a key role in industrial and medical systems. Galvanic isolation in high-speed links ensures the safety of human operators and instruments. Opto-isolators generally achieve high voltage ratings but suffer from delay and reliability concerns [1]. A mm-wave isolator [2] using fiber can transmit 4Gb/s data but it adds system complexity. In contrast, magnetically and capacitively coupled digital isolators are a more compact solution. Conventional digital isolators can tolerate >10kV surge voltage and >50kV/\u03bcs common-mode transient (CMT) across a high-voltage-rated dielectric thin film [3 \u2013 6]. However, their data rate is limited to 0.5Gb/s except for [4], which runs at 2.5Gb/s. To provide isolated solutions for protocols like USB3 and HDMI, isolator data rates must be increased to 10Gb/s. However, doing this in the presence of CMT strikes is challenging because CMT currents can couple through the parasitic capacitance across the thin isolation barrier. To maintain sufficient signal-to-noise ratio, large signal modulation schemes like on-off-keying (OOK) are needed, which require large bandwidths at high data-rates. Reducing the isolation distance usually increases bandwidth and efficiency at the cost of isolation capability. Increasing driver power can compensate for the isolator insertion loss at the risk of exceeding the FCC15 EMI limit. In this work, an integrated galvanic isolated data transceiver is presented. A split-ring resonator (SRR) based isolator, a transformer-based wideband matching network, and a duty-cycle-balancing control circuit have been employed. This digital isolator achieves a data transfer rate of 10Gb/s with deterministic jitter (DJ) of 10.9ps, while keeping the isolation capability of 100kV/\u03bcs common-mode transient immunity (CMTI) and 24kV surge rating.",

        "abstract": "Augmented Reality (AR) will be the next great wave of human-oriented computing, dominating our relationship with the digital world for the next 50 years, much as personal computing has dominated the last 50 [1]. AR glasses require multiple cameras to enable all the computer vision (CV) and AI functions while operating under stringent weight, power, and socially acceptable form-factor constraints. The AR sensors need to be small, ultra-low power, with wide dynamic range (DR) and excellent low-light sensitivity to support day/night, indoor/outdoor, all-day wearable use cases. The combination of lowest power, best performance, and minimal form factor makes AR sensors the new frontier in the image sensors field. In this paper, we explore new sensor architectures and a distributed on-sensor compute system to solve these challenges.",

        "abstract": "As the spatial resolution of mobile OLED displays increases, more than a thousand column channels must be integrated into a source-driver IC (SD-IC). Furthermore, the data resolution of the DAC occupying the majority area of the column channel must become higher for color-depth improvement. The top-left of Fig. 5.9.1 shows a typical SD-IC architecture composed of R-DAC-based column channels sharing a global resistor-string. The switch-array size of the conventional R-DAC increases proportionally to a power of 2 with DAC resolution. Moreover, since the full-scale range ${\\left(FSR\\,=\\,V_{H}\\,-\\,V_{L}\\right)}$ of the R-string is directly correlated with the dynamic range in an OLED display, the R-DAC, including level-shifters (L/S), must be implemented with high-voltage MOSFETs (HV-MOS). Accordingly, even modern CMOS technology nodes are still unable to shrink the SD-IC size considerably. Thus far, many efforts to improve the DAC area efficiency employing a voltage-interpolative sub-DAC have been reported [1 \u2013 3], as shown in the top-middle of Fig. 5.9.1. However, the use of a 2-output HV R-dAc, which occupies 2\u00d7 larger area, is mandatory for voltage interpolation. Mismatch between sub-DACs is also inevitable, and thus the inter-channel uniformity, one of the key performance metrics in a SD-IC, deteriorates significantly. This paper presents an ultra-compact-sized 10b SD-IC achieving an area of 2688\u03bcm2/nel even without adopting voltage-interpolation. As shown in the top-right of Fig. 5.9.1, two key innovations of this work include: 1) a mismatch-insensitive switched-capacitor-based LV-to-HV-amplify DAC, which enables an 8b R-DAC to be realized with only low-voltage MOSFETs (LV-MOS) while obtaining the HV output, and 2) a deviation-free 2b LSB stack-up (LSU) technique enabling finer resolution consuming little area. Considering a 1.5V thin-gate MOS is 24\u00d7smaller than a 5V thick-gate MOS for the same ${R_{\\text{ON}}}$ in 130nm CMOS, this work can achieve dramatic shrinkage of the chip size due to the all-LV-MOS-based R-DAC in conjunction with the elimination of L/S. In addition, both our innovations are highly robust to process variations and thus contribute to overcoming inter-channel mismatch, which is a drawback of prior voltage-interpolative schemes.",

        "abstract": "It is crucial to investigate electrical activities from a single neuron and neuronal synapses in electrophysiology for brain research. Conventional physiological tools such as imaging and labeling are insufficient to cope with neural signals from cells distributed over a large area [1]. Microelectrode array (MEA) systems featuring high-density electrodes and low-noise analog front-ends (AFE) have been representative solutions to acquire intracellular and extracellular potentials from in vitro multiple neurons [2 \u2013 7]. Although the number of electrodes in MEA systems and their spatial resolution are increased thanks to advances in CMOS technology, they still suffer from area constraints in the low - noise AFE and connection complexity from electrodes to corresponding AFE channels. Since neurons are not fully activated and not evenly distributed after being cultivated on an MEA, a full scanning of electrodes in active pixel sensors (APS) is not efficient in terms of power consumption and noise performance [2 \u2013 4]. A switch - matrix (SM) architecture offers high flexibility to select and record electrodes of interest through configuring the switches to randomly connect them to AFE channels, improving efficiency [5,6]. However, a large AFE channel dedicated to an electrode with a small pitch of a few pm limits the scalability in both APS and SM architectures. The more electrodes are integrated into the system, the more complicated the routing connections become, worsening scalability. In this paper, an MEA system with a sub-array multiplexing (SAM) architecture is presented for programmable electrode selection and readout speed to maximize the ratio of the number of recorded electrodes per frame to the total number of electrodes, called an electrode yield. A time-multiplexing scheme allows each AFE channel in a column to record multiple electrodes one-by-one in a given sampling time, alleviating the routing complexity and the number of AFE channels. The reconfigurable SAM provides a pseudo-random connection of electrodes, so that extracellular signals from a single neuron as well as neural synapses can be effectively recorded.",

        "abstract": "The increasing demand for higher network data rates by new businesses and entertainment has never been fulfilled. Mixed-signal PAM - 4 transceivers prevail over their ADC - DSP counterparts in energy efficiency and chip area, but they have difficulties operating over high - loss links. Typically, a continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) and a multi-tap decision-feedback equalizer (DFE) are implemented in a mixed-signal receiver (RX). However, when the data rate reaches 112Gb/s, the implementation of the DFE suffers from stringent feedback timing. Direct DFE works only at 100Gb/s in an optical receiver [1], leaving no room for feedforward error correction (FEC). A speculative 1 - tap DFE is implemented in [2], but it requires an 8-tap feedforward equalizer (FFE) at the transmitter (TX) to generate a 1+0.5D response; this may be impractical without knowing the characteristics of the entire channel. Another drawback of a speculative DFE is the large 1st-tap latency, which brings about challenges in realizing two or more taps. In addition, the DFE does not compensate for pre-cursor inter-symbol interference (ISI), which becomes significant for channels with higher loss. Without a DFE, the CTLE only covers a small loss of up to 10dB [3,4]. This paper presents a 112Gb/s mixed-signal transceiver using an RX analog FFE with adaptive pre- and post-cursor ISI equalization in 28nm CMOS, compensating for 20.8dB loss at a power efficiency of 2.29pJ/b.",

        "abstract": "To satisfy the requirements of the high-order modulations such as 256QAM in 5G RF transceivers, the sampling phase-locked-loop (PLL) [1] is a promising solution as the ultra - low-jitter local oscillator. In the sampling - type PLLs, the design of the crystal oscillator is a key element to achieve low in-band phase noise (PN). Even though the differential structure in [2] or the stacked amplifier in [3] improves the figures-of-merit (FoM) of crystal oscillators, the absolute PNs at the frequency offsets (foffset) of 10k and 100kHz still face difficulties to meet the strict RF clock requirements of 256QAM (i.e. -157.2dBc/Hz at 100kHz foffset). In addition, the 3rd-order polynomial property of the crystal over the temperature causes an issue in the GNSS system, which needs a frequency accuracy of <2ppm. To compensate for the frequency drift over a wide temperature range, the digitally controlled crystal oscillator (DCXO) in [4,5] can be a good solution due to the frequency-tuning flexibility through the capacitive-load (CL)-trimming. However, the CL-trimming of the DCXO over the temperature range changes the equivalent negative transconductance $({V_{\\mathrm{X}}} \\pm {{\\mathrm{V}}_{{\\text{TH}}}})$, resulting in slope (SLC) variation of the sine wave of the DCXO, and consequently leads to PN degradation in the maximum CL case (CMax) compared to the opposite minimum CL case (CMin).",

A SMT8 core with its associated cache is called a core chiplet, and a pair of core chiplets forms a 39.4mm2 design tile. Designed in a 7nm bulk technology, the 602mm2 chip (0.85\u00d7 of POWER9\u2122 [3]) has nearly 18B transistors, 110B vias and 20 miles of on-chip interconnect distributed across 18 layers of metal: 8 narrow-width layers for short range routes, 8 medium-width layers for high performance signals and two 2160nm ultra-thick metal (UTM) layers dedicated for power and global clock distribution. There are 10 input voltages as shown in Fig. 2.4.1: core/cache logic (Vdd), cache arrays (Vcs), nest logic (Vdn), two PHY voltages (Vio, Vpci), stand-by logic (Vsb), a high-precision reference voltage (Vref), DPLL voltage (VDPLL), analog circuitry voltage (VAVDD), and an interface voltage (V3P3). The C4 array contains 24477 total connections (1.25\u00d7 of [3]) with 10867 power, 11879 ground and 1731 signal connections. A core and its associated L2 cache are power-gated together, while the L3 cache is power-gated independently.",

        "abstract": "Monolithic gallium-nitride (GaN) high-electron-mobility transistors (HEMTs) have become popular due to their low parasitic capacitance, low on-resistance (RON), and no reverse recovery charge loss for high-frequency and high-power-density applications [1]\u2013[6]. However, GaN HEMTs have several process defects [7], such as trapping effect and reverse-conduction loss, which will reduce the efficiency of GaN-based converters. Referring to Fig. 14.1.1, during the deadtime, the VSW falls to negative voltage before low-side GaN HEMT (QL) becomes conductive. Even without a body diode, QL will experience \u201cself-commutation loss\u201d when the voltage difference between its gate and drain exceeds the threshold voltage (VTH, E(650V)). The overall efficiency decreases since GaN HEMTs have higher source-to-drain voltage drop (VSD) as compared to the body diode voltage of silicon MOSFETs. Although the power converter presented in [5] uses adaptive deadtime control to achieve a 3% efficiency improvement, due to the unpredictable delay of discrete control, the load-dependent deadtime is still not well controlled. Moreover, considering high switching operation, high dVsw/dt will cause gate ringing problem in switching period. At bottom middle of Fig. 14.1.1, the conventional negative turn-off gate bias and high drain voltage will cause a large electric field between gate and drain, thereby inducing serious trapping effect (bottom left of Fig. 14.1.1). The monolithic GaN driver with adaptive source current (IlCTRL) does not consider the parasitic effects during turn-off period (bottom right of Fig. 14.1.1) [1].",

        "abstract": "The digital injection-locked clock multiplier (ILCM) using ring oscillators (ROs) is a superior choice for clock generation due to its ease of scaling, compact area, and prominent jitter performance. However, the periodic phase realignment in an ILCM can cause a deterministic phase error in the injection moment, which generates an extremely poor reference spur (e.g., \u221250dBc). Several digital calibration techniques [1]\u2013[5] have been introduced to reduce the reference spur. The key is to first detect sources of non-idealities (e.g., imperfect injection timing, frequency drift, and slope modulation), and then to enable a specific calibrator to correct each error source. Unfortunately, there are many non-idealities that can affect the injection performance, such as supply ripples, charge injection of the switches, and clock feedthrough, making it impractical to employ multiple calibration loops to simultaneously mitigate each of them. On the other hand, conventional phase-error-detection schemes [2]\u2013[3], [5] suffer from the timing race between the calibration loop and the injection, and hence elaborate timing control is required to extract errors. This timing-control logic is sensitive to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, leading to inadequate mitigation of the reference spurious power.",

        "abstract": "Intra-cardiac echography (ICE) probes (Fig. 32.2.1) are widely used in electrophysiology for their good procedure guidance and relatively safe application. ASICs are increasingly employed in these miniature probes to enhance signal quality and reduce the number of connections needed in mm-diameter catheters [1]\u2013[5]. 3D visualization in real-time is additionally enabled by 2D transducer arrays with, for each transducer element, a high-voltage (HV) transmit (TX) part, to generate acoustic pulses of sufficient pressure, and a receive (RX) path, to process the resulting echoes. To achieve the required reduction in RX channels, micro-beamforming (\u00b5BF), which merges the signals from a subarray using a delay-and-sum operation, has been shown to be an effective solution [3], [4]. However, due to the frame-rate reduction that is associated with \u00b5BF, these designs cannot serve emerging high-frame-rate imaging modes (~1000 volumes/s) like 3D blood-flow and elastography imaging. In-probe digitization has recently been investigated to provide further channel-count reduction, make data transmission more robust, and enable pre-processing in the probe [1]\u2013[3]. However, these earlier designs have either no TX functionality [2], [3] or only low-voltage (LV) TX [1] integrated. Combining \u00b5BF and digitization with area-hungry HV transmitters in a pitch-matched scalable fashion while supporting high-frame-rate imaging remains an unmet challenge. The work presented in this paper meets this target, enabled by a hybrid ADC, the small die size of which allows for co-integration with 65V element-level pulsers.",

Embedded NN implementations can use locally stored proprietary models, and may operate over private inputs (e.g., health monitors with patient-specific biomedical classifiers [6]), which must not be disclosed. Side-channel attacks (SCA) are a major concern in embedded systems where physical access to the operating hardware can allow attackers to recover secret data by exploiting information leakage through power consumption, timing and electromagnetic emissions [1, 7, 8]. As shown in Fig. 34.3.1, SCA on embedded NN implementations can reveal the model parameters [9] as well as the inputs [10]. To address these concerns, we present an energy - efficient ASlC solution for protecting both the model parameters and the input data against power-based SCA.",

        "abstract": "Pipelined ADCs are widely used for high-speed high-resolution applications, but there are two challenges. First, limited by the kT/C noise requirement, its 1st-stage sampling capacitor has to be sufficiently large (e.g., several pF). This poses significant burdens for the ADC driver and the reference buffer, leading to high design complexity and huge power/area costs on the system level, especially when high linearity, high sampling rate, and low supply voltage are required. Second, it is challenging to design a low-power, high-speed, and PVT-robust residue amplifier in an advanced process. To address these two challenges, this work proposes a PVT-robust ring-amp with kT/C noise cancellation capability. It enables a 1.3mW 200MS/s 67dB-SNDR pipelined ADC with only 128fF input capacitance.",

        "abstract": "In the last decade, hybrid and resonant switched-capacitor (SC) converters have gone from a relatively unexplored concept to one that is gaining widespread adoption in a range of applications [1]. However, despite capabilities to operate efficiently with small passive components, extending these topologies to use silicon-integrated inductors remains challenging [2]\u2013[6]. This work presents a nominally 3:1 step-down resonant Dickson converter targeting low-voltage applications and providing several advances compared to past work. Shown in Fig. 18.4.1, the design uses a merged electromagnetic spiral resonator. As in [3], the merged resonator combines flying capacitance and inductance into a single structure. Shared die area reduces size overhead but also provides current ballasting which counteracts strong high-frequency (skin and proximity) loss effects, enabling high-frequency operation with better efficiency and power density. Improvements from past work include: 1) an extension to higher conversion ratios, which motivates new gate driving and bootstrapping strategies; 2) leveraging magnetic coupling in a Dickson architecture to improve inductance utilization and reduce resonant-frequency variation in phase half cycles; and 3) the design of integrated zero-current (resonant-frequency) autotuning using an on-chip magnetic current-sensing scheme.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-highly linear ADCs, based on continuous-time $\\Delta\\Sigma$ modulators with a (theoretically) linear 1b DAC, have demonstrated better than \u2212100dBc THD in a bandwidth range from tens of kHz for audio to tens of MHz for broadband AM/FM radio [1]. To achieve both a large bandwidth and high dynamic range with a 1 b $\\Delta\\Sigma$ modulator, a high OSR and multi-GHz-rate sampling frequency are required. But there is a limit to the maximum sampling frequency of a $\\Delta\\Sigma$ modulator, being a negative feedback system, in order to maintain loop stability and sufficiently low metastability, for a given technology node. To date, the maximum achievable bandwidth of a high-resolution 1 b $\\Delta\\Sigma$ modulator is limited to a few tens of MHz. To achieve a bandwidth exceeding 100MHz with a single-loop $\\Delta\\Sigma$ modulator, multi-bit quantization is essential [3]\u2013[5]. When employing multi-bit quantization, the inherently linear property of a 1b DAC that consists of only a single unit element is lost, due to processing imperfections that cause mismatch errors between the multiple unit elements of a multi-bit DAC. The impact of static and dynamic mismatch errors can be effectively reduced with calibration, dynamic matching and analog/digital compensation techniques. State-of-the-art ADCs with bandwidths exceeding 100MHz have reported excellent linearity numbers up to \u221283dBc THD [4]\u2013[5], but this is far off from the <-100dBc THD achieved by the ultra-highly linear 1b ADCs. This paper demonstrates a 28nm CT $\\Delta\\Sigma$ ADC that achieves \u2212101 dBc THD in a 120MHz bandwidth, exceeding the state-of-the-art by 17.5dB and 4.8 times, respectively [2]\u2013[5]. The 120MHz bandwidth is realized by employing an offset-calibrated 2b quantizer sampled at 6GHz, and the linearity performance is achieved with a high precision, digitally corrected 2b DAC and has been validated over PVT and local mismatch variation.",

Implemented in a 5nm technology node, a 3.4GHz High-Performance (HP) core is introduced along with circuit and implementation techniques to achieve CPU PPA targets. A die photograph is shown in Fig. 2.5.7. The SoC integrates a 5G modem supporting NR sub-6GHz with downlink and uplink speed up to 7.01Gb/s and 2.5Gb/s, respectively, an ARMv9 CPU subsystem, an ARM Mali G710 GPU for 3D graphics, an in-house Vision Processing Unit (VPU), and a Deep-Learning Accelerator (DLA) for high-performance and power-efficient AI processing. The integrated display engine can provide portrait panel resolution up to QHD+ 21:9 $(1600\\times 3360)$ and frame rates up to 144Hz. Multimedia and imaging subsystems decode 8K video at 30fps, while encoding 4K video at 60fps; camera resolutions up to 320MPixels are supported. LPDDR5-6400/LPDDR5X-7500 memory interfaces facilitate up to 24GB of external SDRAM over four 16b channels for a peak transfer rate of 0.46Tb/s.",

        "abstract": "Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) for collecting ambient mechanical vibration energy have gained popularity as a next-generation energy source owing to their numerous advantages including flexibility, high conversion efficiency, and low cost. However, ultra-high instantaneous open-circuit voltage (~110V) is the fundamental feature of TENGs, and thus they are not very compatible with integrated circuits. Recent TENG-harvesting chips [1]\u2013[3] fabricated in a high-voltage BCD have been reported to be capable of handling up to 70V. Considering TENG's nature of producing a very low alternating current $(I_{\\mathsf{T}})$ of several $\\mu\\mathsf{A}$, the constrained tolerable voltage of the energy-harvesting (EH) interface ICs significantly limits the maximum extractable power to a sub-mW scale. Additionally, it is necessary to reduce the energy wasted to charge and discharge the parasitic capacitance $(C_{\\mathsf{T}})$ of TENG whenever the polarity of $I_{\\mathsf{T}}$ changes. To resolve this, several attempts [3], [4] have been made to apply parallel-synchronized switch harvesting on inductor (P-SSHI) of [5] into TENG-EH circuits. However, the conventional P-SSHI with a bias-flip rectifier can still be valid only within a limited voltage range that a single chip can accommodate.",

        "abstract": "Demands for battery-powered consumer electronics have driven the evolution of power-efficient high-resolution low-bandwidth ADCs. Small area and low power are both critical for these applications due to increasing battery life and shrinking form-factors. Flicker noise poses an issue for such systems although the use of well-known techniques in state-of-the-art designs such as chopper stabilization [1]\u2013[2] are often sufficient for its mitigation. Alternatively, the pseudo-pseudo-differential (PPD) architecture [3] has demonstrated flicker cancellation through the use of single-ended circuits although area and power savings promised by this technique remain undemonstrated. This paper presents a DT single-loop DSM audio ADC utilizing a single-ended ring-amplifier-based integrator to achieve 108.8dB DR with 203.5\u00b5W power consumption within a compact area of 0.0375mm2. The use of the PPD architecture with a merged adder contribute to this work's state-of-the-art power and area efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Today's mobile devices are capable of multiple tasks, including viewing and computer vision. However, these tasks are often implemented using multiple cameras due to divergent requirements, resulting in increases in form factor. Higher resolutions and frame rates are required to take pictures and video, while lower resolutions and frame rates are preferred especially for always-on computer vision to save power. To reduce the form factor, this paper presents a single-chip solution where both high-resolution viewing images and lower-resolution computer vision images are generated from one CMOS Image sensor (CIS). Full field-of-view programmable image resolutions are made possible with floating-diffusion (FD) binning through serial switches. In-frame dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) is applied to minimize power at lower pixel resolutions and frame rates. 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, 1/16 and 1/192 binning modes are demonstrated using a $2560(\\mathsf{H})\\times 1920(\\mathsf{V})$ pixel array that, at 1fps, consumes $790\\mu\\mathsf{W}$ for full-color VGA and 120\u00b5W for motion-detection (MD) mode.",

        "abstract": "Intra-cortical extracellular neural sensing is being rapidly and widely applied in several clinical research and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), as the number of sensing channels continues to double every 6 years. By distributing multiple high-density extracellular micro-electrode arrays (MEAs) in vivo across the brain, each with 1000's of sensing channels, neuroscientists have begun to map the correlation of neuronal activity across different brain regions, with single-neuron precision [1]. Since each neural sensing channel typically samples at 20 to 50kS/s with a > 10b ADC, multiple MEAs demand a data transfer rate up to Gb/s [2]. However, these BCIs are severely hindered in many clinical uses due to the lack of a high-data-rate and miniature-wireless-telemetry solution that can be implanted below the scalp, i.e., transcutaneously (Fig. 24.2.1). The area of the wireless telemetry module should be miniaturized to ~3cm2 due to neurosurgical implantation constraints. A transmission range up to 10cm is highly desirable, in order to improve the reliability of the wireless link against e.g., antenna misalignment, etc. Finally, the power consumption of the wireless telemetry should be limited to ~10mW to minimize thermal flux from the module's surface area, avoiding excessive tissue heating. Most of the conventional transcutaneous wireless telemetry systems adopt inductive coupling, but the data-rate is limited to a few Mb/s. A near-infrared (NIR) optical transcutaneous TX using a vertical-cavity-surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) [2] demonstrated a data-rate up to 300Mb/s but suffers from a limited transmission range (4mm) and requires a sub-mm precise alignment between the implant TX and a wearable RX. Impulse-radio UWB (IR-UWB) is promising for the targeted requirements [3]\u2013[5].",

To secure a high sensitivity at a sub-mW power budget, state-of-the-art Bluetooth Low-Energy (BLE) receivers [1]\u2013[4] can hardly prevent the use of an active RF front-end with at least one transconductance gain (gm). Specifically, although the sub-0.5V LNA [1], [2] and current-reuse LNA-Mixer-VCO cell [3] succeed in power savings, the squeezed voltage headroom tightens the tradeoff between the noise figure (NF) and linearity. The NF and out-of-band (OOB) IIP3 together govern the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR) of a receiver, demonstrating its capability to uphold a minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNRmin) for the demodulator in the presence of blockers.",

Such systems operate predominantly in Sleep mode, regularly marked by brief intervals of Active operation to perform sensing or communication actions. During Sleep, the considerable electrical energy stored in the domain-decoupling capacitor $(C_{0})$ leaks away, requiring the battery to deliver the energy $(E_{\\mathsf{wake}})$ needed to restore $C_{0}$ to $V_{\\mathsf{dd}}$ during the Wake phase ahead of Active mode operation (Fig. 13.7.1). Because of the relatively limited energy dissipation incurred during the brief Active duration, the overhead presented by $E_{\\mathsf{wake}}$ constitutes a significant fraction of total energy dissipation, which degrades battery life significantly.",

        "abstract": "The availability of large amounts of data and advances in modern machine-learning algorithms are pushing the limits of computing systems and redefining the way software is written. This new software paradigm, termed \u201cSoftware 2.0\u201d, is a departure from deterministic computing - centered around exact specifications and expert-created algorithms to accomplish a task - to probabilistic computing, centered around methods that learn to accomplish the same task using several examples. Software 2.0 contains a graph of operations that is rich in data locality and has abundant data, task, and hierarchical pipeline parallelism. Consequently, Software 2.0 can be accelerated by building custom dataflow pipelines. However, conventional GPU systems provide limited flexibility to build such dataflow pipelines. As a result, they suffer from poor device utilization and require a high-bandwidth off-chip memory system, which results in lower memory capacity. Memory capacity limitations impose serious challenges for increasingly larger models and data sets common in the fields of Natural Language Processing (NLP), high-resolution computer vision, and large recommender systems. SambaNova Systems Cardinal SN10 is a Reconfigurable Dataflow Unit (RDU) that enables accelerating Software 2.0 with the flexibility to build custom dataflow pipelines as well as large memory capacity to run big models efficiently [1].",

        "abstract": "Graphic DRAMs have been developed to increase maximum I/O interface speeds to satisfy the demand of high-performance graphic applications [1]\u2013[5]. Recently, PAM4 signaling was utilized to increase the I/O bandwidth up to 22Gb/s/pin [5]. However, the reduced voltage margin of PAM4, compared to NRZ, complicates circuit design; margins also become worse with a reduced power supply. This paper achieves 27Gb/s in NRZ, a 1.5\u00d7 speed enhancement, by improving on previous GDDR6 [3]. A T-coil is designed, for the first time in a DRAM process, so that the maximum operation frequency is increased. The proposed merged-MUX TX increases the maximum speed and reduces power and area consumption. A quad-skew training technique enables a wider clock sampling margin for WCK: up to 3ps, which is 8.1% of 1UI at 27Gbp/s/pin. Furthermore, a dual-mode frequency divider allows a wide-range operation from sub-1Gb/s/pin to 27Gb/s/pin. An alternative-data-bus (ADB) is proposed to solve the frequency limit of the data bus.",

        "abstract": "As the number of devices connected to the loT has increased rapidly in recent years, stricter requirements have been placed on loT radio receivers (RX) that can operate in an increasingly crowded spectrum while maintaining ultra-low-power (ULP) consumption, high sensitivity, and low cost. Prior ULP radios utilizing on-off keying (OOK) modulation with $< 1\\mu \\mathsf{W}$ power consumption offer good sensitivity, but are susceptible to in-band (IB) and out-of-band (OOB) interference and have high latency overhead [1]. As shown in Fig. 24.6.1, high-Q off-chip MEMS resonators and envelope-tracking loops can mitigate OOB blockers and continuous-wave (CW) IB blockers [2], [3], but fail to reject IB pulsed blockers common in the populated ISM bands. Two-tone OOK modulation can alleviate OOB blockers [4], but struggles to address close IB blockers and transient pulsed interferences. The works in [2], [5] achieve strong blocker rejection, but come at the cost of lower sensitivity and higher power consumption compared to other ULP RXs. To address these challenges, we present a dual-chirp OOK (DC-OOK) modulated ULP RX architecture that achieves strong IB and OOB blocker rejection without sacrificing other important RX metrics of sensitivity, power, data-rate, and cost.",

        "abstract": "Contactless 3D scanning systems have attracted rising attention in many fields like industrial measurements, medical systems, and even consumer products. Recently, the range precision of time-of-flight (ToF) CMOS image sensors have been gradually improved using high-speed lock-in pixels [1]\u2013[3], and the possibilities of ToF image sensors in their application to small-size cost-effective 3D scanning systems with sub-1 00\u00b5m precision were previously presented [4]. However, the range precision is influenced by jitter owing to gate drivers, causing a large column-to-column variation of precision. The driver jitter includes a 1/f noise component, so the range precision cannot be reduced even using frame averaging. A frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) LiDAR that has sub-10\u00b5m precision is another candidate for high-precision 3D scanners [5]. However, the FMCW LiDARs only have a single or a few receiver channels. Thus, high-speed 2D mechanical scanning is required for a 3D scanning system. In addition, the FMCW LiDAR using optical coherence in the range measurements has difficulties in real applications, such as a limitation in materials to be measured, system, and large required optical power.",

        "abstract": "The coverage of 5G NR frequency range 2 (FR2) keeps scaling towards over 100GHz. Multi-band receivers have been developed to realize reception over multiple 5G FR2 bands with minimized system size [1]\u2013[3]. The conventional multi-band receiver achieves 20-to-44GHz frequency coverage with wide-band RF response and fixed IF [3]. However, facing the fast-scaling 5G FR2 band, the power consumption of such receivers will be increased tremendously due to the enlarged LO frequency coverage. The Hartley receiver architecture has been introduced to decrease the required LO range [1], [2]. Over 30dB Image rejection could also be maintained to provide the inter-band blocker rejection for a dual-band operation. However, the overall system NF is degraded due to amplified noise from the image band and the achievable bandwidth is also limited. This work introduces a 24.25-to-71GHz phased-array receiver. A harmonic-selection technique is proposed to extend the operating bandwidth with low power consumption and over 36dB inter-band blocker tolerance. The proposed phased-array receiver achieves 256-QAM EVMs of \u221233.3dB, \u221230.9dB, \u221231.6dB, and \u221228.5dB at 28GHz, 39GHz, 47.2GHz, and 60.1GHz, respectively, with the worst-case inter-band blockers. The power consumption for a single receiver channel is 36mW, 32mW, 51mW, and 71mW at 28GHz, 39GHz, 47.2GHz, and 60.1GHz, respectively.",

Data encryption/decryption (data-ED) is also required to prevent access to the neural network (NN) model weights and the personalized data used to improve inference accuracy. This paper presents an AI nvCIM data-ED-capable macro with high energy efficiency (EFMAC), a low macro-level read latency (tAC-M), a high read bandwidth (R-BW), and high-precision inputs (IN), weights (W), and outputs (OUT) for multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. Prior nvCIM macros designed for MAC operations [1]\u2013[3] do not support data-ED or a high number of accumulations (ACU). The use of a single NN layer also requires multiple cycles for full-channel MAC (MACFC-L operations. A low computing latency (tAC-FC-L) and high-precision nvCIM macro with data-ED design faces the following challenges: (1) long tAC-FC-L and low EFMAC for MACFC-L operations, which requires multiple memory accesses with a limited R-BW; (2) long tAC-M due to BL pre-charge (tPRE), signal development (tSD), sensing (tSA), and data-D (tOE); (3) High power consumption for BL precharge, particularly when using a high BL read voltage (VRD) to increase sensing yield.",

Among all technologies, direct ToF sensors based on CMOS single-photon avalanche diodes (SPAD) and time-to-digital converter (TDC) pixel arrays have gradually earned their place in 3D imaging due to their performance and system integrability [1]\u2013[4].",

        "abstract": "Due to the ever-growing demand for higher throughput and longer range from portable devices, wireless transmitters (TX) are required to support wider signal bandwidths and deliver elevated output power, while maintaining high efficiency, especially at power back-off (BO). Recently, digital transmitters (DTXs) that feature arrays of controlled digital-PA (DPA) cells have become increasingly popular, since they directly benefit from nanoscale CMOS technology, yielding reduced die area and highly efficient operation [1]\u2013[4]. However, the lower supply voltages of advanced CMOS nodes present challenges in achieving higher output power with good efficiency. In addition, for cost- and system-complexity reasons, it is very desirable to operate a DTX with a single supply voltage, and, to this end, multicore DPAs with 2- and 4-cores have been reported [4]\u2013[7]. Nevertheless, as more advanced nodes are used, the high output power poses reliability challenges to the circuits. [4] has reported a digital-to-time-converter (DTC)-based polar DTX topology that can support wide bandwidths (up to 160MHz) for dual band WiFi6 applications in 28nm planar CMOS. In comparison, this work presents a DPA that delivers high output power (PMAX of ~2SdBm), adds support for the new frequency bands of WiFi6E (6 to 7GHz), and presents a reliability-aware circuit topology to address the challenges of an implementation in the more advanced 16nm FinFET process node.",

        "abstract": "High-speed (>GS/s) medium-resolution ADCs are in high demand for wideband communication ICs. Meanwhile, the increasing cost in advanced technology nodes favors area-efficient ADC architectures. The traditional voltage-domain time-interleaved (TI) SAR ADC [1]\u2013[2] is a popular choice for its superior power efficiency. However, its single-channel sample rate is generally limited to <1GS/s, necessitating a large number of TI channels in high-sample-rate scenarios. It inevitably increases implementation overhead, including capacitive loading to the input driver and total area consumption. Recently, time-domain ADCs [3]\u2013[5] have shown promising sampling speed, but are mostly based on thermometer coded time-to-digital converters (TDC). Unfortunately, the circuit complexity for such Flash TDC grows exponentially with the target bit resolution. Existing SAR TDCs [6] demonstrate a lower complexity but are generally limited in sample rate (MS/s). In this work, we propose a two-step time-domain ADC that uses a first-stage Flash TDC with the residue time quantized by the second-stage SAR TDC, targeting the >GS/s regime. To further improve the throughput of SAR TDC conversion, we propose a delay-tracking pipelining technique that allows the SAR TDC to quantize two residue time samples, simultaneously. At the circuit level, we use a selective delay tuning (SDT) cell to provide the time reference required for SAR conversion without using an excessive number of delay stages. A proof-of-concept ADC prototype in 14nm CMOS technology with 2x time interleaving achieves 10GS/s with 37.2dB SNDR at Nyquist frequency. It measures an energy efficiency of 24.8fJ/conv-step and occupies an active area of 2850um2, which are the highest reported energy efficiency and smallest area consumption among the state-of-the-art ADCs with> 10GS/s [7].",

        "abstract": "The demand for data across all communication networks continues to grow exponentially. This in turn requires an increase in both capacity and density of backhaul point-to-point (PTP) and point-to-multipoint (PTMP) data links. The D-band frequency range (110 to 170GHz) offers ample spectrum and acceptable propagation characteristics for next generation, high-data-rate backhaul systems [1], [2]. A D-band transceiver (TRX) coupled with a 2D phased-array module can overcome the free-space path loss in a flat panel with added capabilities such as self-alignment and pole-vibration mitigation. Such an FDD system (proposed in Fig. 4.1.1(a)) can also be used in self-organizing networks if deployed in a PTMP configuration. Furthermore, if deployed in a multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) setup it can achieve very-high-throughput wireless links reaching data-rates exceeding 100Gb/s [1]. To demonstrate such a system two main components are required: First, a high-performance D-band TRX capable of high-order, wide-bandwidth modulation such as the one presented in [1]. Second, scalable TX/RX phased-array front-end modules with 2D scanning capability. Recently published D-band phased-arrays [2]\u2013[6] have reduced usability as they can only be scaled in one dimension. To overcome this limitation, a 2D-scalable array must be realized without compromising system performance. Hence, at D-band, this demands new interposer materials and compact TX/RX phased-array chipsets. This is a difficult problem with current packaging technologies due to their limited available routing layers [2], [3]. Moreover, at D-band, the physical dimensions of the antennas and their spacing become comparable to the size of the phased-array chipsets or even smaller [2]\u2013[6]. This work addresses and overcomes the above challenges as follows. First, a low-loss, fine-lithography interposer technology with multi-layer routing is utilized. It is based on a glass substrate with two redistribution layers (RDL) providing four metal layers. The glass substrate acts both as the flip-chip site and integration platform for RF distribution networks, waveguide interfaces, antennas, and digital/power routing. The phased-array TX/RX chips are designed to be directly attached to the antenna feed points, thereby minimizing interface losses. 0.7A (140GHz) antenna spacing was chosen in part for backhaul PTP applications with stringent grating lobe yet relaxed scanning requirements. The architecture of the proposed D-band phased-array module is shown in Fig. 4.1.1(b). The module is built by integrating 64 phased-array TX or RX front-end chips each with four channels for a total of 256 active elements. A 1-to-64-way D-band power-combiner/splitter network based on a substrate-integrated-waveguide (SIW) topology is implemented in the glass. Furthermore, a 256-element antenna array (configured as 16\u00d716) is implemented in the same glass substrate. Each TX or RX channel interfaces to the antenna through a via probe with an annular ring slot as depicted in Fig. 4.1.1(c). An H-shaped, cavity-backed slot in combination with the via probe location controls the antenna's 2-pole response, allowing for a wide fractional bandwidth (>13%). Local RF loop-back capability is also implemented on the glass substrate. This consists of four antenna elements placed on the perimeter of the array. They are routed to either a separate TX or RX chip that samples a small part of the radiated signal (in nearfield) and feeds it back to the RF calibration port of the TRX. The feedback path can be used for factory testing, array calibration, digital pre-distortion (DPD) training and fault detection after field deployment.",

        "abstract": "A mm-wave frequency synthesizer with output >25GHz inevitably faces the problems of a large closed-loop gain $f_{\\mathsf{VCO}}/f\\mathsf{ref}=N$. Phase noise and spurs on the reference input and from other sources in the loop referred to its input are amplified by $N$ A narrow loop bandwidth must be used to limit the resulting jitter. However, now the loop is unable to adequately suppress the oscillator phase noise, leading to a difficult trade-off. At these operating frequencies, the oscillator is inherently noisier since a capacitor bank for digital tuning greatly compromises the overall LC tank quality factor $(Q)$. Therefore, for low output jitter, the synthesizer either needs to allocate disproportionately more current to the VCO than at sub-10GHz, use a sub-10GHz VCO with a frequency multiplier [1], or the reference frequency must be raised to > 100MHz [2], [3], which is beyond the range of reliable, widely available crystal oscillators. In this work, we present a synthesizer that uses a harmonic-mixing (HM) PLL [4], [5] to suppress noise amplification and, therefore, allows the use of a loop with a bandwidth >5MHz. Also, we introduce a coupled mm-wave VCO with only one resonant mode that achieves an FoM (VCO) of 188dB at a 1MHz offset. Combining the two, this synthesizer, driven by a standard 74MHz reference clock, consumes <13mW to deliver 25-to-28GHz output with 88fs rms jitter. It reaches an FoM (PLL) of \u2212250dB.",

Presently, cellular physiology diagnoses rely on high-resolution medical imaging and when translated to a cellular/tissue-level, these images, albeit with different biomarkers, may not holistically characterize a pathogen's effect due to the cell's complex multi-physiological responses [3]. In particular, new pathogen/virus variants often exhibit unknown pathological effects on cellular physiological functions. Hence, desired digital physiology cellular platforms should support sensing a wide variety of cells under different conditions, including those with rapid physiological features, e.g., neuron/cardiac cells.",

        "abstract": "Electrocorticography (ECoG) recording is a non-penetrating electrophysiology technique that achieves a good balance between spatial resolution, brain coverage and invasiveness [1]. For this reason, it is widely used for the diagnosis of neural disorders and holds promise for prosthetic applications. Although ECoG electrodes have been until recently quite large (~4mm diameter), several studies have shown that micro-scale electrodes (< 1mm diameter) are better suited for studying cortical pathology and implementing neural prostheses [2]. The design of flexible, high-density $\\mu\\mathsf{ECoG}$ arrays is challenging since every electrode must be individually addressed, resulting in a wiring bottleneck. Therefore, passive \u00b5ECoG arrays have a limited electrode count and suffer from poor spatial coverage [3]. In contrast, active $\\mu\\mathsf{ECoG}$ arrays have emerged to provide higher spatial coverage with better spatial resolution. The most prominent active array [4] uses Si nanomembrane transistors to multiplex the electrodes and significantly reduce the signal routing. However, the source follower in this array severely limits its noise performance. Moreover, multiplexed $\\mu\\mathsf{ECoG}$ arrays impose additional design challenges on the readout IC (ROIC): i) compared to regular non-multiplexed ROICs [3], at least N times higher bandwidth (BW) is required (where N:1 is the multiplexing ratio); ii) the electrode DC offsets (EDOs) from N electrodes are modulated and cannot be removed with traditional AC coupling or DC servo loops (DSLs); and iii) sufficiently low noise is needed to compensate for the noise aliasing caused by the electrode multiplexing.",

        "abstract": "The incremental analog-to-digital converter (IADC) is attractive in many applications, such as smart sensors and event-driven loT devices, which need ADCs with high resolution, high power efficiency, and can be multiplexed between multiple inputs. Despite these advantages, they usually need an oversampled clock. A self-timed incremental $\\Delta\\Sigma$ ADC is proposed in [1], which does not need any oversampled clock and has similar advantages to self-timed (or asynchronous) SAR ADCs. Since it is automatically powered down once a conversion is completed, it can adapt to a wide range of conversion rates in an energy-efficient way. However, the zero-crossing detector leads to high noise, and correlated level-shifting results in complex self-timed operation. Thus it only achieves a Schreier FoM of 157.1 dB. To increase resolution and reduce power consumption, this paper proposes an improved self-timed incremental zoom ADC. It consumes only $4.96\\mu \\mathrm{W}$ while achieving 93dB SNR in 0.37ms conversion time, resulting in a Schreier FoM of 177.3dB. This is achieved by using an asynchronous zoom ADC structure, and a fully differential self-timed dynamic-amplifier-based integrator.",

        "abstract": "Three major distortion sources in high-fidelity audio decoders are 1) DAC inter-symbol interference (ISI) [1], [2]; 2) 3rd-order harmonic distortion (HD3) due to the 2nd-order nonlinearity of poly resistors; and 3) Cross-over distortion (COD) arising from limited amplifier inner-loop gain due to high output load capacitance (CL) [3], [4]. First, to alleviate the ISI, [1] presents a Real-Time Dynamic-Element-Matching (RT-DEM) algorithm to realize mismatch shaping for DAC cells, achieving 115dB SFDR without complex digital hardware as in [2]. However, the constraint of 1-LSB change with the RT-DEM limits dynamic range (DR) of the $\\Delta\\Sigma$ modulator. Moreover, a high clock rate of 181 MHz causes a high power consumption. Second, with a large signal swing, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of current-to-voltage (I2V) amplifiers is frequently dominated by the HD3 in [1]\u2013[5]. The potential cause of this HD3 is due to the velocity saturation effect (VSE) of poly resistors [6]. Lastly, for a large load capacitance, the damping-factor-control frequency compensation (DFCFC) is commonly applied in multi-stage amplifiers to enhance the stability [4], [5]. However, it degrades the amplifier inner-loop gain and causes severe COD. In [4], a compensation scheme inserts a gain stage inside the inner loop to boost the loop gain over the audio band (20Hz to 20kHz), suppressing the peak COD below \u2212111 dBc. In this work, three techniques are presented to eliminate the aforementioned distortion sources: 1) a code-change-insensitive RT-DEM (CCI-RT-DEM) algorithm is introduced to dynamically select the new start index of rotated DAC cells for the next code, instead of the fixed index at the first one [1], thus allowing for more than 1-LSB change; 2) a poly-resistor linearization scheme is presented to suppress HD3 by mitigating the VSE of resistors; and 3) a 2nd-order DFCFC for multi-stage amplifiers is introduced that allows a high inner-loop gain to suppress the COD, thus enhancing the amplifier linearity even with a large CL. Combining these solutions, the DAC and amplifier together achieve \u2212117dBc THD (\u2212132dBc HD3) and 126dB DR.",

        "abstract": "The Google Quantum AI team's long-term goal is to realize a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computer. Of the technologies available to implement the quantum processor at the core of such a system, solid-state superconducting circuits based on Josephson junctions (JJs) are among the strongest contenders. Recent demonstrations with this technology include computation beyond the capabilities of today's most powerful supercomputers [1] and execution of quantum error correction (QEC) codes that can detect and correct either bit or phase flip errors [2]. These exciting results were enabled by low-error-rate quantum processors with tens of qubits and the supporting infrastructure to run these devices. However, today's quantum computers still have orders of magnitude fewer qubits than is required for a useful fault-tolerant quantum computer; for this, an estimated million or more qubits will be needed and scaling-up today's technology to this extent is non-trivial. Here, we review the Google Quantum AI team's recent progress and future plans. Specifically, we describe our post-classical Sycamore quantum computer and discuss the Google Quantum AI roadmap to fault-tolerant quantum computing.",

Key features of the transceiver include an architecture designed to lower TX signal launch amplitude and RX data path gain to relieve power/area/bandwidth constraints. It achieves required equalization while minimizing residual-ISI and quantization errors for improved performance. It has the capability for RX-driven dynamic adaptation of TX and RX equalization settings for seamless bring-up over hundreds of lanes in an MCM application, as well as to track supply and temperature drifts. It also features programmable TX-FFE roaming taps to boost performance in case of severe reflections and includes precision clock phase generation and correction.",

        "abstract": "Sub-THz radars in CMOS are attractive in vital-sign and security-sensing applications, due to their low cost, small size, and high resolution. The commonly used bistatic configuration, however, leads to serious beam misalignment between TX and RX, when large-aperture lenses/mirrors are used for longer range and higher spatial precision. As shown in [1], a 4mm physical separation between TRX antennas at 122GHz can cause 6\u00b0 TRX beam misalignment, exceeding the 3dB beamwidth of the 29dBi-directivity beam. Monostatic radars are, therefore, preferred in those applications, when sufficient TRX isolation is achieved to avoid saturating the RX. Prior monostatic radars [2]\u2013[6] adopt hybrid/directional couplers for passive TRX duplexing, but at the cost of 3dB+3dB insertion loss inherent to couplers. In [3], such extra loss is mitigated through two sets of hybrid couplers and a quad-feed circularly polarized antenna. Note that in all full-duplex systems, antenna interface mismatch degrades the TRX isolation; in [3], the achieved 26dB isolation relies on excellent antenna matching enabled by backside radiation through a silicon lens. In comparison, frontside radiation allows for low-cost packaging and pairing with compact, large-aperture planar lens, but it causes much degraded antenna matching, hence is challenging for monostatic operation. In this paper, we present a 140GHz monostatic radar in CMOS, which not only circumvents the 6dB inherent insertion loss of couplers, but also facilitates the highly-desired frontside radiation through an adaptive self-interference cancellation (SIC), achieving 33.3dB of total TRX isolation.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-wideband (UWB) technology differentiates itself from other wireless connectivity techniques, such as WiFi and Bluetooth, by providing centimeter-level location accuracy due to its impulse-radio operation. This unique feature draws much interest in smartphones, smart homes, intelligent vehicles, AR/VR, and loT applications since accurate ranging/positioning adds a new dimension to existing wireless communication functions. The recently released IEEE 802.15.4z enhances UWB PHYs to increase the integrity and accuracy of ranging measurement and specifies a security extension for secure ranging [1]. Not many prior works have reported standard-compliant system-level UWB solutions except that some building blocks were discussed, such as coherent transmitters [2], [3]. An integrated UWB transceiver was reported in [4], which contains one transmitter and one receiver. However, the 1T1R architecture must switch between antennas to enable a phase-difference-of-arrival (PDoA) measurement, a primary use case for smartphone applications. Additional switches bring more insertion loss at the RF front-end. Moreover, the ranging time increases since it must measure multiple times, introducing accumulated timing error that significantly degrades the positioning accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Recent work on neural-network accelerators has focused on obtaining high performance in order to meet the needs of real-time applications with vastly different performance requirements, including high precision computation, efficiency for various Deep Learning (DL) layer types, and extremely low power to run always-on applications. Applying a single mode or datatype uniformly across these different scenarios would be less efficient than using different operating modes according to different operating scenarios. For example, super-resolution typically requires FP16 precision for higher image quality, while NNs for face-detection need only INT4 or INT8 precision. Using higher precision than INT8 for face detection would result in higher power consumption. A highly programmable NPU capable of covering the diverse workloads observed in the real world is therefore desired. In this paper, we present a neural processing unit (NPU) optimized with the following features: i) reconfigurable data prefetching and operational flow for high compute utilization, ii) multi-precision MACs supporting INT4,8,16, and float16, iii) a dynamic operation mode to cover extremely low-power or low-latency requirements.

        "abstract": "As data sizes increase exponentially, the demand for higher-density NAND with a smaller cell size and a higher interface speed has also increased [1]\u2013[4]. However, the increased number of WL-stack layers results in a smaller sensing circuit size and a smaller WL-to-WL spacing, which increases the intrinsic transistor variation and the inter-cell interference. One way to achieve good density while maintaining system performance is to support more multiple-plane operations with a circuit under cell array architecture, which leads to an increased noise power. Moreover, to achieve a 2.4Gb/s the I/O circuits need to support the faster speed while achieving lower power consumption. This paper presents the offset cancelling sensing latch (OCSL) scheme, the quad-group interference-free read (Q-IFR) scheme, and the common-source line (CSL) noise-tracking scheme to resolve the aforementioned challenges. In terms of the high-speed I/O bandwidth, a receiver circuit and an internal reference voltage generator are also proposed to increase the I/O speed, reduce the standby power consumption, and reduce the settling time when the chip is enabled.",

Although many radios have been released for various LPWAN standards, such as LTE-M, NB-IoT, LoRa, Sigfox, and WiSUN, they are not suitable for always-on receive-standby operation due to the high DC power dissipation of the receiver (RX) (e.g., >10mW), mandating heavy synchronized duty-cycling. Therefore, LPWAN radios released so far are not suitable for the applications where events occur aperiodically and real-time response is essential.",

        "abstract": "Demands for single-photon-sensitive high-dynamic-range (HDR) imaging in security, automotive, and medical applications have driven development of scalable single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD)-based image sensors. In recent years, 3D-stacking technology combined with advanced CMOS processes has enabled pixel-parallel photon counting in sub-10\u00b5m SPAD pixels. A major technical challenge in realizing high-definition SPAD image sensors lies in a trade-off between power consumption and dynamic range (DR). SPAD pixels inherently consume a considerable amount of power due to the high-voltage operation and high current gain. Power consumption from the SPAD array (PSPAD) grows significantly with increasing incident photon flux, and often dominates over that from the readout circuit under high light conditions. Restricting maximum photon counts per frame could suppress the maximum PSPAD, at the expense of DR. To address this issue, a recharging circuit architecture must be carefully considered. Passive recharging has been widely employed for HDR imaging SPADs [1]\u2013[3], but it is not a viable option for megapixel implementation due to the huge PSPAD, typically reaching tens of watts at excess illuminance. A clocked recharging architecture provides a scalable solution thanks to its compact circuitry and greatly reduced PSPAD at excess illuminance [4]\u2013[6], but to date no existing SPAD sensor has simultaneously achieved megapixel resolution, sub-watt total power consumption, and > 120dB DR.",

        "abstract": "Transformer models have achieved state-of-the-art results in many fields, like natural language processing and computer vision, but their large number of matrix multiplications (MM) result in substantial data movement and computation, causing high latency and energy. In recent years, computing-in-memory (CIM) has been demonstrated as an efficient MM architecture, but a Transformer's attention mechanism of raises new challenges for CIM in both memory access and computation aspects (Fig. 29.3.1): 1a) Unlike conventional static MM with pre-trained weights, the attention layers introduce dynamic MM (QKT, A'V), whose weights and inputs are both generated at runtime, leading to redundant off-chip memory access for intermediate data. 1b) A CIM pipeline architecture can mitigate the above problem, but produces a new challenge. Since the K generation direction does not match the conventional CIM write direction, the QKT-pipeline needs a large transpose buffer with extra overhead. 2) Compared with fully connected (FC) layers, attention layers dominate a Transformer's computation and require > 8b precision to maintain accuracy, so previous analog CIMs [1]\u2013[2] with $\\leq 8\\mathsf{b}$ precision support cannot be directly used. Reducing the amount of computation for attention layers is critical for efficiency improvement.",

        "abstract": "Modern SoCs for advanced wireless/wired applications integrate an increasing number of PLLs. 5G TRXs require multiple PLLs to implement complex schemes of carrier aggregation and MIMO. Multilane high-speed serial links for high data throughput also require many PLLs. To maximize the area efficiency, ring-oscillator (RO)-based digital PLLs (DPLLs) are the obvious alternative to the conventional $LC$-oscillator analog PLLs $(LC-\\mathsf{PLLs})$. To overcome the well-known problem of the high jitter of an RO, the general design guideline is to extend the loop bandwidth. However, this strategy cannot be applied readily to a fractional-$N$ architecture, since a wide bandwidth cannot prevent various in-band noise sources from degrading the overall jitter. Recently, many techniques have been presented to suppress those noise sources. The optimal-threshold TDC (OT TDC) [1] and the noise-shaping BBPD [2] are efficient techniques to reduce the quantization noise (Q-noise) of the TDC. The use of DTCs to cancel the Q-noise of the $\\Delta\\Sigma \\mathsf{M}$ has now become a general solution. To suppress the detrimental effects of the DTC nonlinearity, such as $\\Delta\\Sigma \\mathsf{M}$ Q-noise leakage, fractional spurs, and noise folding, linearization techniques also have been presented. Modulating the statistical property of the $\\Delta \\Sigma \\mathsf{M}$ code (e.g., probability-density-shaping $(\\mathsf{PDS})-\\Delta\\Sigma\\mathsf{M}$ [3]) is another approach to avoid fractional spurs due to the DTC nonlinearity. Recently, the fractional-$N$ RO DPLL in [3] (at the top left of Fig. 23.2.1) achieved the rms jitter of less than 400fs by extending the loop bandwidth in addition to using the various techniques described above to reduce in-band noise. However, this level of rms jitter is still much higher than that of advanced $LC$-PLLs. The graph of the in-band noise sources at the top right of Fig. 23.2.1 shows that, to further decrease the rms jitter, the next challenge is to reduce the thermal noise of the DTC, which increases in proportion to its required range [4]. Spending more power on the DTC might be an easy solution, but it degrades the overall FoMjitter of the DPLL. Thus, more advanced and efficient solutions are needed.",

        "abstract": "Integrated temperature sensors for industrial digital transformation such as turbine and bearing monitoring should exhibit low power consumption and high energy efficiency with moderate inaccuracy over a wide sensing range (e.g., > 150\u00b0C) to achieve autonomous operation under a limited energy budget. Even though resistor-based temperature sensors can achieve a superior sub-pJ.K2 resolution-FoM [1], they typically require a 2-point trim together with a high-order nonlinearity correction (6th-order in [2]), inevitably burdening the processing cost. In contrast, BJT-based temperature sensors in bulk or SOI CMOS can achieve accurate sensing at high temperature with only 1-point trim and simple digital processing [3], [4]. However, they can suffer from a degraded energy efficiency at high temperature for ensuring the sensing resolution and/or accuracy (e.q., ~3\u00d7 increase in bias current for improving the $3\\sigma$-inaccuracy from $\\pm 0.6{{}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}}$ to $\\pm 0.4{{}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}}$ in [3]). This paper describes a BJT-based temperature sensor capable of wide-range operation from \u221250\u00b0C to 180\u00b0C. By employing a nonlinear readout and the proposed subranging, double-sampling, and constant-biasing techniques, this work achieves a high resolution-FoM over the entire sensing range (9.7pJ.K2 at room temperature and 7.2pJ.K2 at 150\u00b0C), corresponding to a 6-to-10\u00d7 improvement when compared with prior BJT-based wide-range designs [3], [4]. We further employ dynamic error-correction [5] and switch-leakage compensation to effectively suppress the mismatch- and leakage-induced errors, resulting in a high precision of $\\pm 0.46{{}^{\\circ}\\mathsf{C}}(3\\sigma)$.",

        "abstract": "Oceans play a critical role in our ecosystem - they regulate weather and global temperature, serve as the largest carbon sink and the greatest source of oxygen. Maintaining ocean health is of paramount importance and has led to the emergence of the \u201cInternet of Underwater Things (loUT)\u201d with intelligent sensors being deployed for aquaculture, environmental monitoring, surveillance, and exploration. Given that RF and optical signals are heavily attenuated in water, and ultrasound (US) - which has favorable propagation underwater - faces a large water-air interface loss (~ 65dB), deep underwater sensing nodes most often communicate data via ultrasonic links to surface buoys, which then use RF to relay data to a remote station. However, such relay-based water-to-air networking solutions are cost and infrastructure intensive, with the inflexibility of anchored buoys prohibiting operation at scale. Wireless, cross-medium communication approaches that do not require intermediary relays would enable large-scale deployment of next-generation loUT sensors. Previously, laser Doppler vibrometers (LDV) [1] and mm-wave radars [2] have been used to remotely detect displacements on the water surface caused by impinging US waves but suffer from poor sensitivity and low data rates.",

        "abstract": "The continuously growing need to move data keeps pushing demands on wireline transceiver speed and power consumption. Multiple I/O transceivers are integrated on a single chip, and the global clock distribution and local clock generation take a significant portion of the total power consumption (Fig. 17.6.1). The phase interpolator (PI) is a crucial block in a transceiver's local clock generator as it provides phase deskew and frequency shifting for the local clock. A local multi-phase clock generator (MPCG) generates the multi-phase input clocks for the PIs from the global differential clock. Conventional 4-phase-clock-interpolation PIs have poor linearity due to intrinsic constellation phase errors and linearity degradation caused by AM-to-PM conversion [1]. Eight-phase-clock-interpolation PIs improve the linearity but 8-phase clock generation requires a power-hungry and noisy ring oscillator [2]\u2013[4]. The 8-phase clock generator also occupies a large area and its operating frequency is limited by the ring oscillator's oscillation frequency. Injection-locked PIs demonstrate great linearity and power efficiency, but their operating frequency is also limited by their core ring oscillator, which has a high number of stages [5].",

        "abstract": "The continuous growth of data-rates has stimulated the rapid development of 5G New Radio (NR) in the mm-wave FR2 bands (above 24GHz). Consequently, to compensate for the mm-wave high path loss, large-scaled MIMO arrays have become essential. This calls for compact high-performance mm-wave 5G front-end electronics to integrate many MIMO channels on the same chip for low cost and low form factor. A main challenge for mm-wave 5G MIMOs is to integrate both front-end transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) chains in each array pixel with a minimum silicon area to form a co-apertured low-cost array [1]. The conventional TRX architecture often consists of a PA and an LNA placed in parallel and combined by a T/R switch to control the TX/RX mode. Although this topology eases the design, it faces chip area increase due to many separate matching networks for the PA/LNA/switch, as well as the switch loss that degrades the PA output power (Pout) and LNA noise figure (NF). On the other hand, though bi-directional mm-wave front-ends are gaining popularity, existing designs only show narrow bandwidth and very limited PA Pout and efficiency.",

        "abstract": "Advances in virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and big data have increased demand for high-bandwidth memory. Accordingly, pre-fetch sizes have also increased with DRAM generations, meaning an increased number of global bus lines. An increase to this number is limited as it also increases the chip size; instead, the data-rate per lane can be increased for higher throughput [1]. As the global bus lines are on-chip wires in a DRAM chip, they can be driven capacitively. Prior work [2], [3] has shown the superior efficiency of capacitive drivers, over conventional repeaters, in driving on-chip wires at the cost of a reduced voltage swing. However, as there is no well-defined DC level on the capacitively-driven wires [4], wire biasing is fraught with implementation challenges [3]. To define the DC potential on the interconnect, prior work sent signals differentially [2], [4], [5] or dissipated static power to define the DC level [3]. Unfortunately, these approaches may not be preferable for DRAM chips that require dense and energy-efficient data transfers.",

        "abstract": "One of the notable trends in convolutional neural network (CNN) processor architecture is to embrace analog hardware to improve energy efficiency in performing multiply-and-accumulate (MAC). Prior works investigated charge redistribution in a capacitor array [4], [5], phase accumulation in oscillators [2], [6], and the integrator in a delta-sigma modulator [3]. However, these works suffer from two critical challenges. First, they all need frequent use of ADCs and DACs to store and access the large intermediate computation results, i.e. feature maps, to and from the digital SRAM. The energy consumption of such data conversion severely limits the overall energy efficiency. To mitigate it, [1] uses analog memory but only for temporary data and it still requires a large amount of data conversion for computing multiple layers of a CNN model. Second, analog circuits including analog memory inherently exhibit non-negligible variability. Important parameters such as comparator threshold voltage, oscillator frequency, etc., vary across process, voltage, and temperature (PVT), limiting the computing precision of analog hardware. It is critical to increase the tolerance to these variations. In this work, aiming to address these challenges, we propose ARCHON, an analog CNN processor featuring an analog neuronal computation unit (ANU) and an analog memory (AMEM). Designed to tolerate a large amount of PVT variations, ANU and AMEM can perform computations needed for a CNN model in the analog domain, across layers, without data conversions. Fabricated in 28nm CMOS, the proposed processor achieves a state-of-the-art energy-efficiency of 332.7TOPS/W (analog datapath) and 19.9TOPS/W (processor level), while maintaining the inference accuracy across supply voltage and temperature variations.",

        "abstract": "Envelope tracking (ET) has become essential technology to save power consumption of RF power amplifiers (PAs) in mobile handsets. 5G NR standard continuously increases their maximum channel bandwidth (CH BW) for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation (CA) to improve data rate. 3GPP TS 38.101 (Release 16) introduces maximum aggregated BW cases of 200MHz (CA_n77C, CA_n78C, CA_n79C), 300M Hz (CA_n77D, CA_n78D, CA_n79D) and even 320M Hz (CA_n46E) [1]. However, the CH BWs that can be supported by conventional analog ET supply modulators, composed of a switching amplifier and an analog linear amplifier, almost reach their limit due to large PA decoupling capacitor (few hundreds of pF) and high-voltage process (>5V). The supply modulator (SM) in [3] isolates decoupling capacitors of unused PAs by a switch, and the linear amplifier in [5] partially employs low-voltage devices to achieve wider BW, however, still 130MHz is the widest envelope-tracking BW among supply modulators with high output voltage (4 to 5V).",

        "abstract": "CMOS image sensor (CIS) technology used for video recording has dramatically evolved in recent years, enabling high-quality image acquisition. Always-on CISs for smart IoT devices should be extremely low-power and have wide dynamic range (WDR) to identify objects at any time, even under harsh illumination. A typical voltage-mode CIS reads out a voltage from the pixel array, converts it to a digital value, and then transfers the data to a frame memory. Since the maximum voltage signal is bounded by the supply voltage, various low-noise CIS techniques have been reported to improve dynamic range (DR) [1], [2]. However, AD conversion and data transfer consume about 90% of total power despite advanced circuit and process technologies [2]. To get around the DR bound due to the supply voltage, several time-mode CISs have been reported, achieving both low power consumption and WDR [3], [4]. For time-mode operation, the in-pixel comparator on a selected row monitors whether the PD voltage has reached a threshold. The elapsed time is digitized by a column-parallel time-to-digital converter. Once the monitoring and conversion for the selected row are completed, the data is transferred to a frame memory, and then the process moves on to the next row. This row-by-row progressive conversion still requires a time-to-digital conversion circuit and a high-speed interface circuit, consuming most of the power. This paper proposes a fully digital time-mode CIS, which introduces a token readout and repeated-scanning scheme for digitization. The scheme removes the time-to-digital converter and the high-speed interface, allowing significant power reduction. All the circuits in the CIS operate dynamically, lowering the power consumption even further.",

        "abstract": "Recently, computing-in-memory (CIM) macros, originally designed to reduce the intensive memory accesses of Al tasks, have been employed in low-power machine learning SoCs due to their ultra-high computing efficiency [1]\u2013[3]. These CIM macros still access weight data through on/off-chip memories, similar to processing elements in near-memory-computing architectures. The implementation poses challenges when counting the overall SoC energy efficiency (Fig. 15.3.1). First, the memory wall issue is unsolved. The weight updates affect overall system performance when large networks are deployed and massive off-chip weight data transfer occurs. Even for tiny machine learning tasks, power consumption and latency of constant weight updates cannot be neglected, because MAC computing efficiency is optimized and closely matches the efficiency of on-chip memory access (2pJ/b vs. 1pJ/b). Second, the viability of structured and coarse-grained sparsity optimization is highly algorithm dependent and requires explicit zero-detection blocks. Power optimization schemes for fine-grained or even arbitrary-sparsity patterns are lacking. Third, edge machine learning chips are cost sensitive. The conventional monolithic SoC design strategy, fabricating one specific SoC for each application, is not affordable in terms of NRE costs.",

        "abstract": "Modern compute SoCs often consume 100s of amperes at voltages of 1V and below which poses huge challenges for delivering power to the socket. Fully integrated voltage regulators (FIVRs) can mitigate these challenges by providing local step-down conversion, hence reducing input current to the socket [1]\u2013[4]. In addition to the large current draw, most digital compute domains employ dynamic power management techniques to optimize power consumption based on performance demand, that results in a large load current range in FIVRs used in granular domains. At the same time, transitions from low to high current can happen at nanosecond timescales. As a result, the FIVR must provide high efficiency over a wide load current range while retaining fast transient response to minimize performance impact from voltage droops. Past implementations used discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) to provide a good light load efficiency [2], however, DCM increases voltage ripple and can hurt transient response.",

        "abstract": "In-memory-computing (IMC) SRAM architecture has gained significant attention as it achieves high energy efficiency for computing a convolutional neural network (CNN) model [1]. Recent works investigated the use of analog-mixed-signal (AMS) hardware for high area and energy efficiency [2], [3]. However, AMS hardware output is well known to be susceptible to process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations, limiting the computing precision and ultimately the inference accuracy of a CNN. We reconfirmed, through the simulation of a capacitor-based IMC SRAM macro that computes a 256D binary dot product, that the AMS computing hardware has a significant root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 22.5% across the worst-case voltage, temperature (Fig. 16.1.1 top left) and 3-sigma process variations (Fig. 16.1.1 top right). On the other hand, we can implement an IMC SRAM macro using robust digital logic [4], which can virtually eliminate the variability issue (Fig. 16.1.1 top). However, digital circuits require more devices than AMS counterparts (e.g., 28 transistors for a mirror full adder [FA]). As a result, a recent digital IMC SRAM shows a lower area efficiency of 6368F2/b (22nm, 4b/4b weight/activation) [5] than the AMS counterpart (1170F2/b, 65nm, 1b/1b) [3]. In light of this, we aim to adopt approximate arithmetic hardware to improve area and power efficiency and present two digital IMC macros (DIMC) with different levels of approximation (Fig. 16.1.1 bottom left). Also, we propose an approximation-aware training algorithm and a number format to minimize inference accuracy degradation induced by approximate hardware (Fig. 16.1.1 bottom right). We prototyped a 28nm test chip: for a 1b/1b CNN model for CIFAR-10 and across 0.5-to-1.1V supply, the DIMC with double-approximate hardware (DIMC-D) achieves 2569F2/b, 932-2219TOPS/W, 475-20032GOPS, and 86.96% accuracy, while for a 4b/1b CNN model, the DIMC with the single-approximate hardware (DIMC-S) achieves 3814F2/b, 458-990TOPS/W (normalized to 1b/1b), 405-19215GOPS (normalized to 1b/1b), and 90.41% accuracy.",

        "abstract": "Factored displays [1]\u2013[4] are a novel kind of computational display which provides a full-parallax glasses-free 3D viewing experience. Compared to other autostereoscopic techniques, factored displays provide greater depth of field, larger field of view, and smoother perspective switching without sacrificing image resolution. Figure 33.3.1 shows an example: a light field consisting of $7\\times 7$-perspective multi views (MVs) is factorized into a set of dual-layer display views (DVs), and displaying the front and rear DVs on two corresponding LCDs can multiplicatively approximate the light field for 3D vision. A higher rank of factorization generates more frames for time-multiplexed display and can improve 3D fidelity with more computation. However, the light-field factorization demands massive memory bandwidth and large computation complexity and becomes a bottleneck for real-time factored displays. For instance, 126.8GB/s of DRAM bandwidth and 4.7TFLOPS of computation are required in a rank-4 factorization at 720p HD 30fps. It is expensive and energy-inefficient to realize these demands in general-propose processors. This paper presents a light-field factorization processor to address the design challenges of memory bandwidth and computational complexity through three key contributions: 1) a half-block-based factorization (HBBF) flow to decouple DRAM access from the iterative nature of factorization to save DRAM bandwidth; 2) a sparse-ray-sampling (SRS) method which reduces DRAM bandwidth and hardware complexity simultaneously; and 3) INT-hybrid optimization for the computation of light-field factorization to save chip area.",

        "abstract": "Massive MIMO or digital-beamforming transceiver systems, shown in Fig. 19.7.1, offer flexibility for multiband, multi-user, and joint communication-and-sensing platforms. However, wideband MIMO applications increase the number of desired or interfering signals that impinge on each channel, creating higher input-power-compression $(\\mathrm{P}_{1\\text{dB}})$ or 3rd-order input-intercept-point (IIP3) linearity requirements in both the transmitting and receiving RF paths. In high-performance commercial and defense radios, CMOS mixers place critical limitations on receiver linearity as the LNA output typically compresses the mixer, leading to recent work on mixer-first approaches in CMOS to improve receiver linearity [1]. When highly linear microwave mixers are demanded, IIIV processes, such as GaAs, are favored for Schottky diodes, which offer lower $\\mathrm{R}_{\\text{on}}\\mathrm{C}_{\\text{off}}$ and high barrier voltages. Commercially available GaAs mixers offer IIP3s exceeding 30dBm. However, III-V mixers typically use a separate process for the driver amplifier, resulting in multiple chips with high driver power consumption (typically exceeding 1W) to deliver the required 15-to-30dBm LO power across a broad LO frequency range [2].",

        "abstract": "Increasing demand for data-rate is pushing wireless links to operate at mm-wave (30 to 100GHz) and subTHz (100 to 300GHz) carrier frequencies, where larger available bandwidth can be leveraged to increase capacity. Novel radio architectures and process scaling are enabling transceiver implementations in low-cost CMOS technologies for commercial applications. Recent publications have demonstrated mm-wave/subTHz transceivers targeting 100+ Gb/s operation with improved efficiencies. Applications range from short/long-range wireless [1] to medium-range links over plastic waveguide [2] with transmitter data-rates up to 140Gb/s and efficiencies of 5 to 10pJ/b. This paper presents a fully integrated D-band transmitter (TX) achieving 160Gb/s at ~ 1 pJ/b efficiency in 22nm FinFET technology. In contrast to many prior works, this performance is achieved while integrating all critical blocks, from bits to RF.",

        "abstract": "The 5G NR frequency band 2 (FR2) standard has evolved to support mm-wave bands spanning from 24 to 40 GHz. Single-band phased-array beam-forming ICs (BFIC) [1]\u2013[3] for 5G have been demonstrated, however, the die size is large. This paper describes a 5G BFIC that supports both N257/N258/N261 (24.25 to 29.5GHz or Low-Band) and N260 (37 to 40GHz or High-Band) FR2 bands, each with 16 antenna ports and concurrent dual polarization for RX/TX, and its corresponding quad-stream intermediate-frequency IC (IFIC), supporting non-contiguous intra-band carrier aggregation (CA) up to 1.6GHz total bandwidth (BW). Figure 27.1.1 shows a 5G mobile phone, where multiple (3 to 4) BFICs, integrated with antenna modules, are placed in parallel and perpendicular to the phone screen for enhanced spherical coverage. BFICs and the antenna module have a skewed aspect ratio to support phone thickness requirement. A power-management IC is integrated on the module, which further reduces area available for the BFIC. However, a traditional BFIC die-size increases in proportion to the number of bands supported, and the IFIC size grows in order to have dedicated signal paths to support multiple BFICs. This paper introduces architecture and circuits techniques to enable area-efficient design of 5G FR2 transceivers.",

        "abstract": "In this session, eight papers highlight developments in digital clocking, variation tolerance and power management. The session opens with a clock generator incorporating various safety mechanisms to achieve ISO26262 ASIL-D requirements. For clocking circuits, two papers on injection-locked clock multipliers demonstrate: 1) a power-gating injection-locking architecture with a background multi-functional digital calibration, and 2) an injection-pulse-shaping technique. The next paper describes a fully automated hardware-driven clock-gating architecture to reduce dynamic clocking power in a 5nm mobile SoC. For variation tolerance, two papers demonstrate: 1) a microprocessor with digital voltage-droop sensors and a voltage-control loop to offset loadline uplift plus noise effects, enabling a runtime algorithm to boost the core clock frequency, while not exceeding the maximum voltage requirement (VDD,MAX) for reliability, and 2) a fully synthesizable digital temperature sensor using only logic transistors and metal wires. The last two papers on power management describe: 1) a power management architecture to recycle the energy stored in the decoupling capacitor before a processor enters sleep mode, and 2) an ultra-low-power SoC for IoT applications, featuring energy-performance scaling, event-driven fast DVFS and minimum energy-point tracking.",

However, for a wearable device to be a convenient continuous recording system in one's daily routine, technical issues in ECG become more important. First, long-term monitoring should be robust against massive environmental interference. The interference affects the device in the form of common-mode interference (CMI) caused by coupled disturbances from surrounding powerlines. Common-mode charging/discharging at the input stage has been proposed in 2-electrode systems using switched capacitors [1] and current sources [2] to provide the effective function of a driven-right-leg (DRL) circuit.",

In particular, Hidden Network (HNN) [2] proposed a training method that finds such accurate subnetworks (Fig. 15.4.1). HNN extracts the sparse subnetwork by taking a logical AND of an initial model's random weights and a binary mask that defines the selected connections - a supermask. The importance of each connection, quantified as a score, is evaluated in the training phase; a supermask is learned by picking the connections with the top-k% highest scores. Although similar to pruning, supermask training is clearly different in that it never updates the initial random weights.",

        "abstract": "Automotive and industrial applications require a high-efficiency DC-DC converter to directly convert power from the 12V intermediate bus to a low-voltage point-of-load (PoL). The double step-down (DSD) buck converter [1]\u2013[4] (shown in Fig. 18.3.1) is suitable for such applications, where a flying capacitor $C_{\\mathrm{F}}$ sustains a half-input-voltage $(V_{\\text{IN}}/2)$ stress. Therefore, all the power switches only experience $V_{\\text{IN}}/2$ stress except $M_{\\mathrm{A}2}$, allowing for exploiting the benefits of low-voltage devices. Two pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ with an equal duty cycle $D$ drive the DSD. A $\\text{PoL}$ supply should have a small output capacitor $C_{0}$ if a fast dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) is needed. However, a small $C_{0}$ in the conventional DSD may cause a large output undershoot $V_{\\text{US}}$ during a transient event. This comes from the low inductor current slew rate $I_{\\mathrm{L}_{-}\\text{SR}}=(V_{\\text{IN}}/2-2V_{0})/L$, due to the amplitude of the inductor switching nodes $V_{\\text{XA}1}$ and $V_{\\text{XB}1}$ being reduced to $V_{\\text{IN}}/2$ by $C_{\\mathrm{F}}$, and the non-overlapping $\\phi_{1}$ and $\\phi_{2}$ in a conventional $D\\leq 0.5$ control. Furthermore, the $D$ should cover a wide range to respond to an integral transient error in the control loop compensator. With $D\\leq 0.5$, the DSD converter may fail to cancel the error in time, and the accumulation and release of the error result in overshoot/ringing. This would be more severe at a higher output voltage $V_{0}$ because the steady-state $D$ is closer to 0.5. A possible solution can be to have a DSD converter that works with $D>0.5$. Nevertheless, this leads to an over-sterss on $M_{\\mathrm{A}1}$, and imbalance in inductor currents $I_{\\text{LA}}$ and $I_{\\text{LB}}$, which should be eliminated [3].",

Nonvolatile computing-in-memory (nvCIM) reduces the data transfer overhead by bringing computation closer, in proximity, to the memory [1]\u2013[4]. While the multi-level cell (MLC) has higher storage density than the single-level cell (SLC). A few MLC or analog nvCIM designs had been proposed, but they either target simpler neural-net models [5] or are implemented using a less area-efficient differential cell [6]. Furthermore, representing the entire weight vector using one storage type does not exploit the drastic accuracy difference between the upper and the lower bits.",

        "abstract": "Ultra-sharp beam forming and high-angular-resolution steering in both azimuth and elevation directions are required in high-performance imaging sensors, spatial-multiplexed wireless links and other applications. This poses great challenges due to the fundamental relationship between the beamwidth and the dimension of the antenna aperture. As shown in Fig. 4.5.1, the aperture size required to achieve 1 \u00b0 of 3dB beamwidth is $0.6\\times 0.6\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ and $0.2\\times 0.2\\mathrm{m}^{2}$ at 24GHz and 77GHz, respectively. In current radars, sparse MIMO antenna schemes are adopted to synthesize virtual arrays with the above size in one dimension. However, they require intensive signal processing of many channels. The complex signal routing and placement of active electronics also leads to challenges in the 2D scaling required for pencil beam forming. By increasing the wave frequency to 265GHz, the work in this paper significantly reduces the aperture area, allowing it to be fully realized by digitally controlled, reflective antennas in CMOS microelectronic chips (Fig. 4.5.1). Similar to a concave mirror, a reflectarray, when illuminated by a single radar source, applies incident-angle-dependent phase shifts (e.g. $\\varphi_{1}$ and $\\varphi_{2}$ in Fig. 4.5.1) to the wave and re-focuses it towards a desired direction. This quasi-optical spatial feed eliminates the high-frequency signal routing and complex processing inherent to MIMO arrays. Employing $98\\times 98$ antenna elements, we experimentally demonstrate the forming and electronic steering of a THz pencil beam with- 1 \u00b0 beamwidth in two dimensions. With under-antenna integration of dense memory cells, sidelobe reduction and squint correction are also achieved.",

        "abstract": "Ponte Vecchio (PVC) is a heterogenous petaop 3D processor comprising 47 functional tiles on five process nodes. The tiles are connected with Foveros [1] and EMIB [2] to operate as a single monolithic implementation enabling a scalable class of Exascale supercomputers. The PVC design contains> 100B transistors and is composed of sixteen TSMC N5 compute tiles, and eight Intel 7 memory tiles optimized for random access bandwidth-optimized SRAM tiles (RAMBO) 3D stacked on two Intel 7 Foveros base dies. Eight HBM2E memory tiles and two TSMC N7 SerDes connectivity tiles are connected to the base dies with 11 dense embedded interconnect bridges (EMIB). SerDes connectivity provides a high-speed coherent unified fabric for scale-out connectivity between PVC SoCs. Each tile includes an 8-port switch enabling up to 8-way fully connected configuration supporting 90G SerDes links. The SerDes tile supports load/store, bulk data transfers and synchronization semantics that are critical for scale-up in HPC and AI applications. A 24-layer (11-2-11) substrate package houses the 3D Stacked Foveros Dies and EMIBs. To handle warpage, low-temperature solder (LTS) was used for Flip Chip Ball Grid Array (FCBGA) design for these die and package sizes.",

        "abstract": "Vision systems with artificial intelligence (AI) for applications requiring image classification are in growing demand. However, the imager plus dedicated AI accelerator solution [1] suffers from the burdens of power and latency caused by the raw image data traffic between the imager and the companion signal processor with a neural network accelerator, making it unsuitable for the real-time inference in low-power edge devices. Recently, imagers with near- or in-sensor processing capability have been developed [2]\u2013[6] to improve the system efficiency for specific applications. In [2]\u2013[4], the near-sensor Haar-like filtering operations are implemented in imagers to realize face detection (FD). However, unlike using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with programmable weights for different tasks, the implemented features of such prior works are limited and not configurable. In [5], a convolutional CMOS image sensor (CIS) with near-sensor analog multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations was reported for assisting with the 1st-layer computations of a CNN. However, the convolutional CIS is inadequate for some tasks, due limits on the numbers of layers/kernels, and needs a companion digital accelerator for the required operations (Rectified Linear Unit: ReLU, Maximum-Pooling: MP, Fully-Connected layer: FC, etc.) of a complete CNN model. In [6], an analog convolutional CIS is reported with a 5-layer network for CNN implementation. However, the analog MAC operations using charge sharing with a capacitor array leads to gain loss, low weight resolution, and limited accuracy. Moreover, the ReLU+MP operation using a static winner-take-all circuit is power hungry. To address these issues, we present an intelligent vision sensor (IVS) with an embedded tiny CNN model and programmable weights to achieve configurable feature extraction and on-chip image classification using a mixed-mode processing-in-sensor (PIS) technique.",

        "abstract": "Many PLLs, including those used for mm-wave 5G communications, require deep-sub-picosecond integrated phase jitter [1]. Their in-band phase noise (PN) can be adversely affected by flicker noise and a large feedback frequency-division ratio, N. Cascaded PLLs are a recent trend in addressing this problem [2]\u2013[4]. They are composed of two stages: the 1st stage (PLL #1) receives an external frequency reference FREF to generate a filtered reference of several GHz feeding into the 2nd stage (PLL #2) that features a lower division ratio and a wide bandwidth for better overall jitter performance. Although the cascaded PLL can chose from various combinations of oscillators, e.g., LC-tank and ring-oscillator (RO), the PLL #2 using an RO can benefit from a small size, easy integration, wide frequency-tuning range (FTR), and multiphase clock outputs (e.g., for directly supporting multibeam antenna arrays). Normally, the RO-PLL cannot achieve the same jitter performance as an LC-PLL, but here a low value of $N$ in the wide-bandwidth integer-N configuration of PLL #2 makes this distinction less relevant.",

Given the same 7nm process technology as the prior-generation \u201cZen 2\u201d core [1], as well as the same platform infrastructure, the primary \u201cZen 3\u201d design goals were to provide: 1) a significant instruction-per-cycle (IPC) uplift, 2) a substantial frequency uplift, and 3) continued improvement in power efficiency. The core complex unit (CCX) consists of 8 \u201cZen 3\u201d cores, each with a 0.5MB private L2 cache, and a 32MB shared L3 cache. Increasing this from 4 cores and 16MB L3 in the prior generation provides additional performance uplift, in addition to the IPC and frequency improvements. The \u201cZen 3\u201d CCX shown in Fig. 2.7.1 contains 4.08B transistors in 68mm2, and is used across a broad array of client, server, and embedded market segments.",

        "abstract": "Resistive RAM (RRAM) is an exciting technology that exhibits various new properties that have been long absent in traditional charge-based memories. RRAM features high-bit density, non-volatile storage, accurate compute in-memory (CIM), and both process and voltage compatibility. Each of these properties makes RRAM a compelling candidate for Al applications, particularly at the edge. To demonstrate the utility of these properties, we direct our effort to real-world event-driven and memory-constrained applications, such as recommendation systems and natural language processing (NLP). To enable these applications at the edge, higher memory capacity and bandwidth must be achieved despite irregular data access patterns that prevent effective caching and data reuse. Furthermore, we find that these applications are rarely (if ever) run continuously, but instead execution is triggered by events. The combination of these two challenges makes RRAM an ideal candidate given its high density and non-volatility enabling near-zero leakage power and complete power down. To address these challenges, this paper presents a 2.25MB RRAM based CIM accelerator with 765kB of SRAM and an embedded Cortex M3 processor for edge devices.",

        "abstract": "Combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are ubiquitous in applications such as finance, logistics, drug discovery, supply chain optimization, and public transportation. However, many COPs are non-deterministic polynomial-time hard (NP-hard), which require significant computation costs using conventional computers. Recently, Ising machines based on quantum annealing [1] and CMOS technologies [2]\u2013[5] have received growing interest as efficient hardware accelerators that could replace traditional computing hardware (CPUs and GPUs) for solving real-world COPs. An Ising model, a basis of the Ising machines, finds the optimal (or sub-optimal) solutions of the COPs by efficiently exploring a solution space based on its intrinsic convergence property towards the lower Ising Hamiltonian (or energy). Another critical enabler is the annealing process, which prevents the Ising machine from converging to local minimum solutions and increases the chance to find the global optimum. Existing Ising machines with fixed hardware topology based on simple graphs (e.g., King's graph [2] [4]) are ill-suited to a practical Ising model with arbitrary spin interactions. In contrast, a fully connected Ising machine [3] can map a wide range of Ising models, but at the cost of significant overheads in area, power consumption, and latency. A recent work [5] demonstrated a reconfigurable Ising machine that enables an arbitrary interaction between spins. However, it has a restricted number of interactions per spin (up to 8) due to the fixed hardware topology (King's graph), which only allows eight interactions. In this paper, we propose an Ising machine that allows up to 28 arbitrary spin interactions based on flexible spin processing element (PE) circuits with temporal reconfigurability (i.e., multi-cycle operations with decomposed spin maps) to overcome the limited spatial spin interactions of the prior CMOS Ising machines. The proposed Ising machine with multi-spins embedded in each PE and multi-chip spin operations provides a scalable solution for solving the more complicated COPs.",

        "abstract": "SRAM-based computing in memory (SRAM-CIM) is an attractive approach to improve the energy efficiency (EF) of edge-AI devices performing multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations. SRAM-CIM with a large memory capacity enhances EF by reducing data movement between system memory and compute functions. High-precision inputs (IN), weights (W) and outputs (OUT) are essential to deliver sufficient inference accuracy using SRAM-CIM. These devices must also enable a short compute latency $(\\mathrm{t}_{\\text{AC}})$ and a high multiply-accumulate throughput (TP) to achieve a fast system-level response time for an inference task. However, previous SRAM-CIMs using voltage-mode in-memory computing (VM-IMC) [1], [3]\u2013[6] or time-domain near-memory computing (TD-NMC) [2] are unable to simultaneously achieve high EF, high readout accuracy, and a short $\\mathrm{t}_{\\text{AC}}$ for high-precision MAC operations; as increasing IN-W-OUT precision and/or the number of accumulations (ACCU) leads to (1) an exponential decrease in the signal margin that causes a readout accuracy degradation for VM-IMC schemes, and (2) an increased maximum MAC value (MACV) and memory capacity (increased parasitic load), which increases $\\mathrm{t}_{\\text{AC}}$ and the energy consumption for VM-IMC and TD-NMC schemes, as Fig. 11.8.1 shows. This work presents a time-domain in-memory-computing SRAM-CI M structure: (1) It uses a time-domain incremental-accumulation (TDIA) scheme to enable MAC operations with a high ACCU and a consistently large signal-margin across MACVs. (2) It also uses a dynamic differential-reference time-to-digital converter (D2REF-TDC) that is based on a software-hardware co-design, which reduces read energy consumption. A 28nm 1 Mb SRAM-CIM macro fabricated using foundry-provided compact 6T-SRAM cells achieves MAC operations with 64 accumulations of an 8b input and an 8b weight and a near-full precision output (22b). The proposed macro also achieves the shortest reported $\\mathrm{t}_{\\text{AC}}$ and a $0.3\\text{ns}/\\mathrm{b} \\ \\mathrm{t}_{\\text{AC}}$ per output-precision $(\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{A}\\mathrm{C}\\mathrm{p}\\text{OUT}})$ with a 1241.2GOPS TP and a high 37.01TOP/W EF for 8b-MAC operations.",

        "abstract": "With the increasing demand for low-power, high-speed DRAMs, LPDDR5 featuring a speed of 6.4Gb/s has recently been announced [1]. One of the most critical issues of high-performance DRAM is the supply-noise induced jitter (SIJ) generated by the clock distribution network (CDN) and the transmit and receive paths. Conventional CDN SIJ coping methods use supply voltage regulators and decoupling capacitors. Unfortunately, a supply regulator is not suitable for low-voltage mobile DRAM due to the required drop-out voltage headroom, while the decoupling capacitor cannot sufficiently filter low-frequency noise without requiring excessive area. In this paper, we propose an SIJ cancelation technique based on an adaptive filter (AF) using a least mean square (LMS) algorithm; it cancels jitter along the CDN and the transmit and receive paths, which include serializers and pre-drivers. The proposed technique includes a 2nd-order AF to maximize jitter cancellation in the clock path, which has a non-linear supply-to-jitter characteristic [2]. Implemented in 28nm CMOS, the proposed SIJ cancellation scheme reduces the RMS jitter of the RDQS_c clock from 27.33 to 4.20ps and improves the data eye opening from 22.34 to 99.12ps when operating at 6.4Gb/s with a $60\\text{mV}_{\\text{p-p}}$ 1 MHz supply noise.",

        "abstract": "To pursue the ever-growing trend in mobile data-rates, modern transceivers exploit carrier aggregation and high-order modulations, at the price of calling for ultra-low jitter (below 100fs) and frequency-agile local oscillators. Although the bang-bang digital-PLL (BBPLL) architecture can meet the stringent 5G jitter requirements at low power consumption and silicon area [1], its inability to quickly recover from a frequency jump, caused by the narrow linear range of a bang-bang phase detector (BBPD), has so far prevented its application when frequency agility is an important requirement. A high-resolution and wide-range time-to-digital converter (TDC), rather than a BBPD, would solve this issue at the price of larger power and area. As a matter of fact, fast-hopping ADPLLs using multibit TDCs have been demonstrated in applications with relaxed jitter specifications [2], [3]. To break the trade-off between frequency agility and jitter-power product, auxiliary frequency-acquisition loops have been recently adopted in BBPLL architectures [1], [4], [5]. Those auxiliary loops, based on extra BBPDs, control the digitally-controlled-oscillator (DCO) frequency with a gain larger than that of the main loop, thus decreasing the settling time. Unfortunately, above a certain control-gain value, the system nonlinearity introduces an unwanted dependence between the main and auxiliary loops, limiting locking time to several thousands of reference cycles.",

        "abstract": "The CMOS image sensor, which incorporates a silicon photodiode array and a signal processor on a chip, or in a multi-die stack, has become an indispensable part of our daily lives. While its dominance in digital image capture will foreseeably continue, research with future outlooks is actively searching for new optoelectronic devices, alternative to silicon photodiodes, to place on the CMOS signal processor. Two-dimensional (2D) semiconducting materials, in particular, atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers-which are one of the most actively researched solid-state materials-are especially promising candidates for these applications [1], [2]. The vision arises from the fact that TMD monolayer crystals of different chemical compositions exhibit different bandgaps, or different absorption wavelengths from infrared to visible, and that these atom-thick crystals with differing bandgaps can, in principle, be van der Waals stacked to produce diverse spectral sensitivities beyond what is possible with conventional CMOS image sensors. Despite this vision, however, TMD arrays, such as those made from $\\text{MoS}_{2}$ optoelectronic devices (photo-FETs), have been limited to 32 x 32 thus far [3], and have not been integrated on CMOS signal processing chips; graphene was integrated with CMOS electronics, but this semimetal uses additional layers, such as quantum dots, for light absorption [4].",

        "abstract": "Recently, Transformer-based models have achieved tremendous success in many AI fields, from NLP to CV, using the attention mechanism [1]\u2013[3]. This mechanism captures the global correlations of input by indicating every two tokens' relevance with attention scores and uses normalized scores, defined as attention probabilities, to weight all input tokens to obtain output tokens with a global receptive field. A Transformer model consists of multiple blocks, named multi-head, working with the attention mechanism. Figure 29.2.1 details the computation of an attention block with query (Q), key (K), and value-matrix (V), computed by tokens and weight matrices. First, Q is multiplied by KT to generate the attention score matrix. The scores in each row, represented as $\\mathrm{X}_{\\mathrm i}$, indicate a token's relevance with all others. Second, the row-wise softmax with inputs of $\\mathrm{X}_{\\mathrm{i}}-\\mathrm{X}_{\\max}$ normalizes attention scores to probabilities (P), expanding the large scores and reducing the small scores exponentially. Finally, probabilities are quantized and then multiplied by V to produce the output. Each output token is a weighted sum of all input tokens, where the strongly related tokens have large weight values. Global attention-based models achieve 20.4% higher accuracy than LSTM for NLP and 15.1% higher accuracy than ResNet-152 for classification.",

        "abstract": "With the COVID\u201319 pandemic, the faster and more reliable connectivity solutions in data centers became the critical enabler technology of our daily activities. The current 50G data center switches have more than 500 lanes within a single chip solution [1]. This massive integration puts strict restrictions on power/area consumption. Moreover, single-domain, low supply voltage operation is highly desirable for better package/board designs as well as improved silicon reliability with less aging impact. An ADC-based receiver with DSP equalization consumes higher power/area due to the time-interleaved ADC array and digital domain FFE/DFE taps [2]. An analog CTLE/DFE-based transceiver with a single supply level is highly suitable for low power/area operation for high density IOs in data center switches. The TX driver supply level can be adjusted based on the application.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents a1Tb 4b/cell 3D-NAND-Flash memory on a 176-tier technology with a 14.7Gb/mm2 bit density. The die is organized using a 4-plane architecture for multiplane operations with a 16KB page size. The 1\u00d74 plane architecture improves both program and read throughput, without increasing the die size. Periphery circuitry and page buffers are placed under the array using 5th-generation CMOS under array (CuA) technology. To improve random read performance, a faster read is provided with a read concurrency feature: allowing four independent multiplane page read addresses. The 4b/cell capability is reached using negative voltage for an expanded window in the negative region and a positive SRC bias, both of which aid in extended reliability. The programming operation is based on a 16\u201316 programming algorithm. The I/O transfer speed is 1600MT/s in ONFl4.2. The 3D-NAND Flash technology has improved significantly in its performance and reliability, enabling a design of a high density of 4b/cell (QLC) device.",

Main innovations include a voltage-interval-based dual-mode AC-DC conversion and an active zero-crossing buffer in the AC interface, which significantly reduces the size of the HV buffer capacitor $C$b and enables on-chip integration. The converter supports both AC-DC and DC-DC conversion with an input voltage range of 15 to 325V.",

        "abstract": "The era of AI computing brings significant challenges to traditional computer systems. As shown in Fig. 29.1.1, while the AI model computation requirement increases 750x every two years, we only observe a very slow-paced improvement of memory system capability in terms of both capacity and bandwidth. There are many memory-bound applications, such as natural language processing, recommendation systems, graph analytics, graph neural networks, as well as multi-task online inference, that become dominating AI applications in modern cloud datacenters. Current primary memory technologies that power AI systems and applications include on-chip memory (SRAM), 2.5D integrated memory (HBM [1]), and off-chip memory (DDR, LPDDR, or GDDR SDRAM). Although on-chip memory enjoys low energy access compared to off-chip memory, limited on-chip memory capacity prevents the efficient adoption of large AI models due to intensive and costly off-chip memory access. In addition, the energy consumption of data movement of off-chip memory solutions (HBM and DRAM) is several orders of magnitude larger than that of on-chip memory, bringing the well-known \u201cmemory wall [2]\u201cproblem to AI systems. Process-near-memory (PNM) and computing-in-memory (CIM) have become promising candidates to tackle the \u201cmemory wall\u201d problem in recent years.",

The first paper in the session describes the design of an ADC-based 224Gb/s PAM-4 receiver circuit, extending the data rate by 2\u00d7 compared to prior art. The second paper demonstrates the current state of the art of 112Gb/s ADC-DSP based transceivers, achieving transmission over a 50dB-loss channel while consuming only 4.5pJ/b. Papers 6.3-6.6 demonstrate how mixed (analog/digital) implementations can reduce energy consumption and chip area, and enable advanced equalization such as multi-tap DFEs. The session concludes with Paper 6.7, where a 2x50Gb/s link on a plastic waveguide is demonstrated with an integrated frequency tracking loop to enable coherent demodulation at low power consumption.",

        "abstract": "Compact and low-cost reflection-mode active imagers with a high angular resolution that can form images through a variety of obstacles and operate in visually impaired conditions are needed in industrial, security and safety applications [1]. Achieving a sub- 1 \u00b0 angular resolution using 79GHz CMOS radar imagers, which is far off from ~0.1 \u00b0 for lidars, requires an aperture larger than ~600cm2. This paper reports a 430GHz $1\\times 3$ CMOS concurrent transceiver (TRX) pixel array that is used with a 6cm diameter Cassegrain-type folded-path reflector (area = ~28cm2) to form images of objects in heavy fog around 3m away with an angular resolution of 0.7\u00b0. The pixel integrates an antenna, a transmitter, a coherent receiver, an LO generation and synchronization circuits in an area close to $(\\lambda/2)^{2}$ at 430GHz [3], [4]. The pixel achieves a minimum DSB noise figure $(\\text{NF}_{\\text{DSB}})$ of ~39dB and the $1\\times 3$ pixel array exhibits a measured peak effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of -4dBm at DC power consumption of 85.8mW for the 3 pixels. Compared to the state-of-the-art concurrent TRX pixel operating at ~430GHz [3], the new pixel achieves ~15dB lower $\\text{NF}_{\\text{DSB}}$. This work demonstrates reflection-mode imaging using a concurrent TRX pixel array without the aid of optics in the signal transmission and reflection paths. These pixels can be used to form a focal-plane array (FPA) for an increased field of view (FoV) with orders of magnitude lower power consumption compared to that of phased arrays at a given angular resolution.",

        "abstract": "Emerging mobile platforms, such as autonomous robots and AR devices, require RGBD data and 3D bounding-box (BB) information for accurate navigation and seamless interaction with the surrounding environment. Specifically, the extraction of RGB-D data and 3D BB needs to be done in real-time (> 30fps) while consuming low power (< 1W) due to limited battery capacity. In addition, a conventional depth processing system consumes high power due to a high performance (HP) time-of-flight (ToF) sensor with an illuminator (> 3W) [1]. However, even the HP ToF fails to extract depth in areas of extreme reflectance, leading to failure in navigation or AR interaction. In addition, software implementation on an application processor suffers from high latency (~ 0.1 s) to preprocess the depth data and process the 3D point cloud-based neural network (PNN) [2]. Therefore, this paper proposes an SoC for low-power and low-latency depth estimation and 3D object detection with high accuracy, as shown in Fig. 33.4.1. The system implements depth fusion [3], [4] to allow accurate RGB-D extraction without hollows, while using a low-power (LP) ToF sensor (<0.4W). The SoC can fully accelerate the depth-processing pipeline, achieving a maximum of 45.6fps.",

        "abstract": "The sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication is emerging and continuous the increase of the speed and data-rate achieved by 5G. A major challenge in 6G is to provide a large transmitter output power (Pout) with high energy efficiency and linearity from a limited supply voltage to overcome high path loss, given the inevitable exploitation of higher millimeter-wave (mm-wave) frequencies (W-band and above) [1]\u2013[5]. The low breakdown voltage of silicon-based processes limits the use of \u201cvertical\u201d power-boost techniques, such as using higher voltages and stacking more transistors. Therefore, the \u201chorizontal\u201d on-chip power-combine technique has attracted more attention. Due to the poor passive efficiency and the physical implementation difficulty, power-combine techniques suitable for high mm-wave systems are scarce. Most of the PAs adopt zero-degree power-combine technique at W-band [3]\u2013[5]. However, the nature of the proportional impedance-transformation ratio with the power combining typically limits the number of combined unit PAs to less than 16 [3]\u2013[5], so that the resulting Pout is generally less than 20dBm.",

        "abstract": "12V/24V-to-1V power converters with high efficiency and fast transient responses are highly desirable in industrial and automotive applications. Double step-down (DSD, also known as series-capacitor) converters are among suitable candidates, as they provide 2\u00d7 duty-cycle extension and 2\u00d7 equivalent switching frequency with reduced voltage stress on power transistors by adding only one flying capacitor into a two-phase buck converter [1]. However, it is still challenging to robustly control a DSD converter to achieve fast transient responses. Hysteretic control is widely used in the buck converters for its simple structure and fast responses. However, it may not be feasible to apply hysteretic control to a DSD converter as the on times of the two phases must have 180\u00b0 phase shift and cannot be overlapped. PWM control with fast Type-III compensation [2] is another attractive option, but it suffers from an inherent delay up to half of a switching period when responds to a load transient, as will be explained later. In [1], an adaptive on/off time (AO2T) control approach is proposed to improve the responses by extending the on time during the transient. However, the 10% settling time of $8.2\\mu\\mathrm{s}$ is longer than 16 switching periods for a load step of only 1A and a complicated phase mirroring circuit is also needed. Moreover, as the operation principle of the DSD converter prevents the two phases from being turned on simultaneously, the benefit of doubling the slew rate of the inductor current which is taken advantage of by the two-phase buck converter disappears.",

        "abstract": "The pipelined SAR ADC is a promising architecture to achieve high sample rate with high resolution. Residue amplifiers are normally required between pipelined stages to provide sufficient gain for relaxing the noise requirement in subsequent stages. However, these amplifiers generally induce issues such as large power consumption, stringent linearity requirements, and PVT-sensitive gain errors [1], [4]. Moreover, reduced voltage dynamic range in deep submicron nodes presents challenges for the design of high-performance amplifiers and fine quantizers in voltage domain. Therefore, implementing the fine quantizer in time domain becomes attractive due to its better noise tolerance and lower power consumption. Nevertheless, the linearity and conversion speed of the time-to-digital converter (TDC) used as the fine quantizer degrades quickly with the increase of its resolution due to the exponentially increased hardware. Moreover, its full-scale and resolution are determined by the delay cells and are thus sensitive to PVT variations. In prior-art, the time-domain assisted SAR ADC [2] adopts a current-discharging-based inner-tracking technique in a voltage-to-time converter (VTC) and TDC to compensate PVT variations, yet the conversion speed is limited by slow conversions of the VTC and the TDC. The digital slope assisted SAR ADC [3] guarantees that the time full-scale is aligned with the LSB in the voltage-domain. However, the architecture doesn't fully exploit the benefits of time-domain conversion since the ADC resolution is still dependent on the unit-capacitor switching, leading to an enlarged MSB-to-LSB ratio in the CDAC",

Prior art in Pls is limited to 7-8b measured resolution [1]\u2013[4], and INL of >500fs [1]\u2013[4]. We present a 9b Pl; even with the additional bits, the proposed PI consumes low power of 0.43mW/GHz and a small area. The worst rotation spur is at least 8.1 dB lower (than [4]), and DNL/INL values of 295fs/510fs are $> 144\\times$ better than prior-art. Implemented in 5nm technology at VDD $=075\\mathrm{V}$, our design leverages digital and analog techniques easily suited to FinFET operation.",

        "abstract": "Flow sensors with high resolution $(<200\\mu\\mathrm{g}/\\mathrm{h}/\\surd\\text{Hz})$ and low offset drift $(<\\pm 0.4\\text{mg}/\\mathrm{h})$ are essential in many microfluidic applications, such as flow cytometry and biological/chemical assays. Although thermal flow sensors can meet these specifications [1], [2], they measure flow velocity, so their calibration is fluid specific. Coriolis flow sensors [3]\u2013[5] are a promising alternative because they measure mass flow and density regardless of fluid type, thus offering more flexibility. However, this has typically been at the expense of lower resolution, offset drift, and large footprint. This paper presents a mass-flow-to-digital converter ($\\phi$ DC) based on a MEMS Coriolis mass flow sensor and a dedicated readout IC (ROIC). Compared to the state-of-the-art [5], it is more compact and has a digital output. Furthermore, it achieves a 3x improvement in resolution (100 $\\mu$ g/h/ $\\surd$ Hz) and a more than 2 $\\times$ improvement in zero stability ($\\pm$ 0.35mg/h}.",

A traditional processor is composed of many elements including instruction decoders, arithmetic logical units, register files, and I/O systems. In quantum processors, these functions are distributed across two elements often separated by many meters: a qubit plane and a control system. The qubit chip is sometimes referred to in isolation as a quantum processing unit, but in reality is merely a quantum memory. Quantum logic operations are actuated through external stimuli that manipulate and measure the quantum state of the qubit chip.

        "abstract": "The demand for greater I/O bandwidth in data centers is increasing due to the explosive growth of network traffic. However, conventional high-speed interconnects are struggling with the challenges in both functional and economical aspects. Copper-based electrical links are displaying their critical bandwidth limitation caused by skin loss. Optical links require significant capital expenses for the E/O and O/E conversion devices and the chip-to-fiber assembly in short-reach high-volume links. As an alternative, the recent studies present that the plastic waveguide links showing the inherent low-loss and wideband channel characteristics can be a promising solution to provide the power-/cost-efficient high-speed interconnects. However, prior arts have demonstrated only a single waveguide transmission due to the low confinement of the waveguide [1]\u2013[4] and a limited carrier synchronization requiring external local oscillator (LO) phase tuning [2]\u2013[4]. In this paper, we demonstrate a 1m 50Gb/s PAM-4 bi-directional plastic waveguide link with carrier synchronization using 70GHz transmitter (TX) and receiver (RX) ICs in fan-out wafer-level packaging (FOWLP) fabricated in 28nm CMOS. The link achieves an FoM of 2.8pJ/b/m showing state-of-the-art performance in terms of throughput-distance, and energy efficiency.",

Most VAD and KWS ICs focused on reducing the power of the feature extractor (FEx) as it is the most power-hungry building block. A serial Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based KWS chip [1] achieved 510nW; however, it suffered from a high 64ms latency and was limited to detection of only 1-to-4 keywords (2-to-5 classes). Although the analog FEx [2]\u2013[3] for VAD/KWS reported 0.2\u03bcW-to-1 \u03bcW and 10ms-to-100ms latency, neither demonstrated >5 classes in keyword detection. In addition, their voltage-domain implementations cannot benefit from process scaling because the low supply voltage reduces signal swing; and the degradation of intrinsic gain forces transistors to have larger lengths and poor linearity.",

        "abstract": "High conversion-ratio (CR) DC-DC boost converters are essential for LED backlighting in smartphone and tablet displays. For realizing a high CR, a conventional boost (CB) converter [1] shown in Fig. 18.7.1 would use a large duty ratio D and thus have short on-time of power switch $\\mathrm{S}_{2}$. This not only limits the converter switching frequency $\\mathrm{f}_{\\text{SW}}$ but also results in a large inductor current ripple $\\Delta \\mathrm{i}_{\\mathrm{L}}$. As high CR also leads to a large average inductor current $\\mathrm{I}_{\\llcorner}$ under a given output current $\\mathrm{I}_{0}$, the power efficiency of the CB converter would be significantly degraded due to enlarged inductor conduction loss with large $\\Delta \\mathrm{i}_{\\mathrm{L}}$ and $\\mathrm{I}_{\\llcorner}$. Hybrid boost converters are recently reported. Both converters in [2], [3] add a capacitor path in parallel with the inductor to reduce the inductor current stress, while a two-phase converter in [4] doubles its switching pulse width and $\\mathrm{f}_{\\text{SW}}$ through 2-phase operation with 2 inductors. However, compared with the CB converter, their improvements in CR are limited within 2 times. Moreover, output-voltage-rated power transistors that have larger on-resistance and parasitic capacitance are required in prior hybrid boost converters [2]\u2013[4], resulting in higher power losses and inferior performances in high frequencies.",

        "abstract": "With advances in deep-neural-network applications the increasingly large data movement through memory channels is becoming inevitable: specifically, RNN and MLP applications are memory bound and the memory is the performance bottleneck [1]. DRAM featuring processing in memory (PIM) significantly reduces data movement [1]\u2013[4], and the system performance is enhanced by the large internal parallel bank bandwidth. Among DRAM-based PIM proposals, [3] is near commercialization, but the required HBM technology may prevent it from being applied to other applications due to its high cost [5]. In this situation, an accelerator-in-memory (AiM) based on GDDR6 may be applicable: it has a relatively low-cost, is compatible with GDDR6 interface, and is designed to accelerate deep-learning (DL) applications. AiM offers a peak throughput of 1 TFLOPS with processing units (PUs) with a speed of 1 GHz utilizing the characteristics of GDDR6 with a speed of 16Gb/s. It can also support many applications as it has various activation functions. This paper first looks at the AiM architecture and the supported command set for DL operations. Next, the DL operations in the PU and supported activation functions are described. Finally, we present evaluation results of DL behavior of AiM at the package and the system level.",

        "abstract": "Recent wearable blood pressure (BP) measurements that are based on the pulse transit time (PTT) require additional bothersome contact for their subordinate electrocardiogram (ECG), such as from the opposite hand's finger. This extra contact disrupts continuous BP monitoring during daily activities. A proposed neckband-based device allows continuous BP measurement just by wearing it, and a proposed baseline-tracking impedance plethysmogram (IPG) facilitates daily-life BP measurement based on the PTT at the carotid artery [1]. For this purpose, a mixed-mode baseline cancellation (MM-BC) scheme is proposed to achieve wide-range fine-canceling capability for baseline wanders; this improves upon conventional bio-impedance methods that adopt only one analog-tuned [2] or digital-assisted [3] control loop. For fine and robust detection of the IPG, a two-step CT ADC is designed to include an artifact detection scheme. For effective support of 4-electrode (4E) and 2-electrode (2E) setups in bio-impedance measurements, a proposed phase-synchronization scheme requires only one channel for the I/Q detection, while conventional schemes utilize two channels [2]\u2013[5]. For system-level verification, a bio-potential channel for the ECG is also integrated, and the IPG-based BP function is experimentally verified through a neckband device prototype.",

        "abstract": "To generate low-jitter, high-frequency signals with ring oscillators (ROs), injection-locked clock multipliers (ILCMs) are the most suitable architecture due to advantages such wide bandwidth and fewer noise sources. However, they have two inherent issues. The first is that their jitter performance is sensitive to PVT variations. To address this problem, recent RO-ILCMs have been equipped with a multi-purpose, real-time digital calibrator that can remove both the frequency error of the RO and the phase error of the calibrator [1]\u2013[2]. The second is that their operational stability and jitter performance degrade rapidly as the multiplication factor, N, increases. This issue, which has yet to be well addressed, is rooted in the fundamental limitation of the typical injection-locking method, i.e., injecting narrow pulses into the RO (top left of Fig. 13.2.1). When the free-running frequency of the RO deviates from the target frequency, $Nf_{\\text{REF}}$, where $f_{\\text{REF}}$ is the frequency of the reference clock $(\\mathcal{S}_{\\text{REF}})$, the core current of the RO $(I_{\\text{osc}})$ and the $\\text{injecting}$ current $(I_{\\text{INJ}})$ should be out of phase to satisfy the oscillation condition by creating the necessary phase shift. Thus, the effective magnitude of $I_{\\text{INJ}}$ at $N f_{\\text {REF, }} \\text {i.e}., I_{\\text{INJ,eff }}$, relative to $l_{\\text{osc}}$ determines the maximum phase angle, $\\phi_{\\text{MAX}}$, and, thus, the maximum lock range, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{L},\\text{MAX}}$ [3]. However, for a large $N, I_{\\text{INJ,eff} }$ becomes extremely small, sharply reducing $\\phi_{\\text{MAX}}$ and $\\omega_{\\mathrm{L},\\text{MAX}}$. Although the RO-ILCMs in [4]\u2013[5] achieved a total $N$ of over 40 by using a reference doubler or quadrupler, their two-stage operation offers limited improvement of the jitter $\\text{FoM}$. MDLL-based implementations are better suited for larger N, but the time required for edge switching limits the maximum output frequency, $f_{\\text{OUT}}$, and the value of N.",

        "abstract": "A ring oscillator (RO) generates a multi-phase clock with a large tuning range in a small area, enabling a per-lane implementation in multilane communication applications. However, a high-frequency RO suffers from inferior phase noise, which is exacerbated by its high flicker-noise corner [1], being unsuitable to be a precision-timing clock source for a high-throughput interface. While injection locking widens the noise-suppression bandwidth of an RO-based phase-locked loop (PLL) [2], its effectiveness to overall jitter is limited only to those with low multiplication factors. By exploiting the accumulation-free nature of jitter in delay-locked loops [3], the reference multiplier in [4] generates a clean mid-frequency clock and then is cascaded to a high-frequency PLL, achieving a low output jitter despite a high multiplication factor. However, the background calibration for the large delay errors in the reference multiplier due to process, supply voltage, and temperature (PVT) variations necessitates an excessive settling time, which is in the order of a few milliseconds at worst. While the reference multiplier in [5] achieves very low noise, its calibration, which also requires a long settling time, should be preceded by a post-fabrication trimming. In [6], another viable method for reference multiplication is presented. However, the long calibration time remains unsolved due to the required low noise contribution of its calibration PLL. In this paper, we present a 100MHz-reference, 8GHz/16GHz RO-based injection-locked all-digital PLL (IL-ADPLL) that incorporates a reference octupler (8xREF) with a probability-based adaptive calibration algorithm. The presented algorithm enables a fast, accurate phase-error calibration both under startup and after sudden environmental disturbance, e.g., a supply hop.",

        "abstract": "Energy-efficient matrix-vector multiplications (MVMs) are key to bringing neural network (NN) inference to edge devices. This has led to a wide range of state-of-the-art MVM acceleration chips, which fall into two categories: 1) Digital NN accelerators [1]\u2013[2], constituting widely parallel multiply-accumulate (MAC) arrays at medium (typically 4-8b) precision. 2) Analog in-memory compute (AiMC) NN accelerators [3]\u2013[4], which enable much higher energy efficiencies and throughput per unit area at the cost of a reduced computational precision, reduced dataflow flexibility, and resulting reduced mapping efficiency for some layer configurations. Neither of these approaches dominates the other, as it depends on the layer type which approach is the optimal. The ideal processor would enable exploiting both digital and AiMC NN acceleration concepts and select the best accelerator depending on the layer characteristics. Consequently, this work presents DIANA, a low-power NN processing SoC, comprising a precision-scalable digital NN accelerator, an AiMC core, an optimized shared-memory subsystem and a RISC-V host processor to achieve SOTA end-to-end inference at the edge. This SoC includes innovations in: a) its 16x16 digital NN core with flexible dataflow for fully connected and high-precision CONV layer execution, b) its 1152x512 AiMC core with SIMD digital post-processing and support for output unrolling for improving array utilization, and c) a shared memory system supporting efficient layer-fused execution schedules, controlled by the RISC-V. This allows simultaneous execution of subsequent layers across the digital and analog cores, assigning high-precision layers and layers with limited AiMC utilization (e.g. FC layers and layers with low channel count) to the digital core, and all other intermediate layers to the AiMC core. A top-level overview of the designed system and its highlights is depicted in Fig. 15.6.1.",

In addition, such applications require a high bandwidth of> 10kHz as fast neuronal magnetic activity should be acquired close to the skeletal muscle directly. This paper presents a 2.6mW magnetometer with $10\\text{pT}/\\sqrt{}\\text{Hz}$ input-referred noise and 33kHz signal bandwidth. The proposed magnetometer adopts a digital calibration scheme that automatically maximizes the loop gain and loop bandwidth with low power consumption for low-noise and high-bandwidth realization. The normalized energy of the proposed magnetometer reaches 1.6pJ, improving power efficiency compared with state-of-the-art designs [2]\u2013[5], while maintaining a low noise characteristic.",

        "abstract": "The noise figure (NF) of the low-noise amplifier (LNA), located at the forefront of wideband receivers, directly influences the total NF of the receiver. A popular approach to suppress the noise of the input transistor to decrease the LNA NF is to utilize a noise-cancelling (NC) technique, where the main amplifier provides input matching, while the auxiliary amplifier removes the noise of the main amplifier [1]. In this scenario, the common-gate (CG) common-source (CS) NC LNA has been widely investigated because it features simultaneous noise and distortion cancellation. To achieve a NF of 3dB, the CG-CS LNA in [2] consumes 15.4mA. By employing the $g_{m}$ -boosting technique, a NF of 3.5dB is achieved in [3] while consuming 7.5mA. Benefiting from the current reuse technique, the current dissipation in [4] is reduced to 4.5mA with a NF of 2.09dB. For these reported works, the noise contribution of the auxiliary amplifier dominates the NF. However, the noise factor contributed by the auxiliary amplifier is inversely proportional to its transconductance $(g_{m})$; hence, the noise contribution of the auxiliary amplifier can only be reduced by increasing $g_{m}$ at the cost of current dissipation, rendering the NC LNA a power-hungry component of a wideband receiver.",

        "abstract": "An ultra-low-power always-on voice activity detector (VAD) is the key enabler of acoustic sensing in wearables. The VAD listens to the environment and wakes up the main system only when there is a right activity detected. Since most human-centric applications have infrequent activities, the VAD dominates the system power. The traditional VAD using the digital feature extractor and classifier [1] requires full-bandwidth and high-resolution data conversion before digital-signal processing, drawing a substantial power $(> 20\\mu\\mathrm{W})$. Recently, the analog feature extractor shows more promises in power reduction. In [2], the analog-filter bank brings the feature-extraction power down to $1\\mu \\mathrm{W}$ (Fig. 22.5.1, upper). Yet, the analog-filter bank does not support reprogramming and has a large area (\u223c0.1 mm2/channel) that limits the number of input channels of the following deep neural network (DNN). The mixer-based analog filter in [4] succeeds in squeezing the feature-extraction power (142nW), but the time-interleaved operation prolongs the decision latency (512ms), and limits the extractable features (only the diagonal information on a spectrogram). In [5], the SNR-based VAD avoids the analog-filter bank, but the involved active circuitry raises the power budget and limits the performance in term of decision latency and classification rate.",

        "abstract": "Soil monitoring provides comprehensive information on the ecosystem and soil functions, but it involves intensive field sampling and costly laboratory analysis. Advanced wireless sensor networks ease the sampling process and labor efforts [1]. However, the proliferation of wireless environmental monitoring applications is problematic in maintaining the power required for proper operation. Also, battery poses issues for minimizing sensor nodes and limiting environmental pollution. Ambient energy harvesting offers an alternative power supply to operate the sensor interface and wireless transceiver [2]\u2013[5]. However, batteryless wireless sensor nodes typically suffer from low RF-powering sensitivity (~ -20dBm) [2], [5] and a short communication distance [4], making them unsuitable for wide-range environmental monitoring.",

        "abstract": "Compact and high-power bidirectional wireless power transfer (WPT) systems are desirable for mobile device-to-device (D2D) wireless fast charging. Prior WPT solutions [1]\u2013[3] with integrated Class-D power amplifier (PA) provide relatively low output power (<10W). A Class-E PA has higher output power capability than a Class-D PA with the same input voltage. The 70W single-ended Class-E PA in [4] uses one additional bulky discrete MOSFET working as a tunable capacitor for impedance matching, achieving zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) and zero-voltage-derivative-switching (ZVDS) with 50% switching duty cycle across wide load and distance ranges. The 100W differential Class-E PA in [5] provides higher output power but requires a discrete impedance tuning network with 2 $\\mathrm{C}_{\\text{BLOCK}}^{\\prime} \\mathrm{s}, 3\\mathrm{R}_{\\text{DC}}\\ ^{\\prime}\\mathrm{s}$, and 2 MOSFETs. These two solutions are well suited for pad-to-device wireless charging, but are hard to be embedded in a mobile phone. In addition, to regulate the PA output power, the supply voltage of the PA is tuned by a DC-DC converter in a conventional two-stage solution. In this work, we design a compact single-stage regulated Class-E architecture with adaptive ZVS control for D2D wireless fast charging.",

        "abstract": "For more efficient power management in processors, a high-frequency and multi-phase (MP) integrated voltage regulator (IVR) using multiple inductors would be an ideal solution to deliver optimized power with rapid dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) [1]\u2013[5]. Nevertheless, in practical use, MP-IVRs suffer from an inter-inductor current imbalance because of mismatches in integrated inductances, different parasitic resistances, and duty-control skews among all phases (top of Fig. 18.1.1). Such a current mismatch may cause larger output ripple and efficiency degradation, losing the benefits of multi-phase operation. Also, thermal hotspots can occur due to excessive current density and deteriorate reliability. Previous approaches [2], [4] use current sensors to calibrate the duty cycle of each phase, but the design complexity and power overhead tend to be greatly increased in the high-speed sensing circuitry for fast-switching converters. An additional consideration in MP-IVRs is the phase-shedding technique, which can improve the light-load efficiency by reducing the number of phases. In many prior works [1], [2], the number of phases was adjusted by 2N (e.g., 1-2-4) for simplicity of phase division. If the phase-shedding is more fine-grained, the overall efficiency can be more flattened over a wide range of loads. Moreover, because the frequency response and output ripple vary according to the number of phases, the MP-IVR should be adaptively optimized further for them. This paper presents a 400MHz 6-phase fully integrated buck converter (bottom of Fig. 18.1.1). Key contributions of this work include 1) inter-inductor true-average-current matching by the flying-capacitor-based peak-and-valley differential sensing (PVDS) technique with near-zero power overhead, 2) area-efficient dynamic re-allocation of on-chip capacitors used either in the PVDS or at the output for optimizing responsiveness and voltage ripple adaptively to the number of phases, and 3) DLL -based multi-phase clock generation (MPCG) for fine-grained phase-shedding functionality, improving efficiency over a wide load range.",

The situation deteriorates drastically under the industry trend towards higher power density and switching frequency, $\\mathrm{f}_{\\text{SW}}$, where the impacts of the parasitics adversely grow against efficiency, reliability, and performance. Although system-in-package technologies are helpful, the improvement is essentially limited and cost remains high [1].

        "abstract": "Comparators are the core of analog-to-digital converters (ADC), used as sense amplifiers in on-chip data-communication links and memories. The time taken by a clocked comparator to resolve analog inputs near its input-referred noise level into digital output (called CLK-OUT delay, Fig. 3.3.1) often dictates the system's throughput for a given SNR. For SAR ADCs where each bit is determined sequentially, CLK-OUT delay presents a bottleneck in realizing high-speed operation, e.g. beyond 1 00MS/s in 5G/6G baseband application. For a 12-bit 100MS/s SAR ADC at 1 V, e.g., the comparator should resolve signals below 0.5mV within 500ps. Time-interleaving increases ADC throughput but at the cost of increased clock power. Therefore, low-noise energy-efficient GS/s comparators with sub-500ps CLK-OUT delay are indispensable not only for multi-Gb/s serial communication, but also in 5G/6G baseband ADCs. By eliminating static current, dynamic comparators (e.g. Elzakker [1], dynamic bias [2], inverter-amplifier [3]) perform comparisons with high energy efficiency for a given noise level. However, the energy-efficiency of these techniques [1]\u2013[3] has been demonstrated only at low comparator speeds (below 100MS/s) with CLK-OUT delay in the range of a few ns [2] to tens of ns [3]. High-speed (GS/s) comparators [4]\u2013[7] have been demonstrated at only medium noise level (a few $\\text{mV}_{\\text{RMS}}$) and are energy-inefficient. This work presents an energy-efficient GS/s comparator targeting low-power and low-noise applications in high-speed ADCs and serial communication. The proposed comparator's CLK-OUT delay and input-referred noise remain well within 500ps and $0.5\\text{mV}_{\\text{RMS}}$ over wide input-common-mode voltage, $\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{CM}}$ (0.3 to 0.6V) while still maintaining <100fJ per comparison.",

However, MEMS sensing areas (on the order of 1 $\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$) are several orders of magnitude lower than the mass deposition focus beam ($\\text{mm}^{2}$ -scale), dramatically reducing the probability of detecting molecules, thus increasing the detection time [2]. NEMS and CMOS co-integration has already been considered but the density NEMS arrays limits the detection probability and scalable readout circuits fully suitable to NEMS pixel constraints e.g. size, power consumption, resolution has not been proposed yet. We propose the first realization of a fully 3D-monolithic 1024 zepto-balances (zBal) array including NEMS-based gravimetric sensor [2] and readout circuits individually addressed by on-chip matrix decoder and voltage drivers and controlled by a shared phase-locked loop which scans sequentially two resonant frequencies of each NEMS. We report a zBal readout with 0.5mW power-consumption, $375\\mu\\mathrm{m}^{2}$, silicon footprint and 0.28ppm frequency-resolution variability for a 10ms individual NEMS acquisition time. The 0.7% frequency variability measured on 1024 NEMS arrays allows higher effective sensing area than the previously published active NEMS sensors [3]\u2013[5].",

An on-chip RC oscillator is one of the promising candidates since it can be fully integrated with standard CMOS technology. Typically, an RC oscillator is implemented with a comparator that periodically resets a capacitor voltage at an interval defined by a fraction of the RC time constant to generate a stable output frequency. Therefore, the RC time constant needs to be invariant to the supply voltage and temperature changes. Also, the comparator must be high power, so that its temperature-dependent delay becomes negligible compared to the RC time constant.",

        "abstract": "Efficient THz generation in silicon technologies has been of great interest over the recent years, as it enables an integrated low-cost solution for sensing, radar, communication, and spectroscopy [1]. Due to the limited $\\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{T}}/\\mathrm{f}_{\\max}$ of transistors, direct THz generation using a fundamental oscillator is not feasible; therefore, various approaches have been developed based on harmonic extraction and the frequency multiplication of a fundamental oscillator [2]. In these techniques, the nonlinearity of transistors is utilized to generate higher harmonics from a fundamental oscillator or frequency-multiplier cells; however, such systems have a poor efficiency and low radiated power due to device limitations. To compensate for the low generated power, a coherent array scheme is preferred to increase EI RP and radiated power. Adjusting the phase and locking the frequency of elements for coherent operation are important factors in array architectures, which can be performed through central LO distribution [3] and mutual coupling [4]. LO distribution can cause phase mismatch between elements and significantly increases the DC power consumption by adding more blocks. Mutual coupling through injection locking can maintain phase alignment. However, this type of coupling has low tuning range, which makes it challenging to synchronize elements over a broad frequency range. In this work, a technique for THz CW generation is presented, in which, instead of relying on transistor nonlinearity, a PIN diode is used in the reverse recovery mode for strong harmonic generation. A PIN diode, similar to a step recovery diode (SRD), benefits from a sharp reverse recovery and is highly nonlinear in the recovery mode, which enables efficient THz harmonic generation by upconverting the output of a mm-wave oscillator without requiring additional blocks and multipliers. The PIN-based array consists of 2x3 elements, where differential Colpitts oscillators are used as the core to push the PIN diodes into reverse recovery. Array elements are intercoupled using a collective coupling approach that enables wide tuning range and phase match between elements. The PIN-based array achieves a radiated power of 0.31 mW and 18.1dBm EIRP at 425GHz.",

        "abstract": "Energy harvesting and power management units (EHPMUs) are gaining popularity for self-powered Internet-of-Things (loT) applications due to their ability of extracting ambient energy and powering load circuits through a single block. Among all EHPMU architectures, the multi-input single-inductor multi-output (MISIMO) [1]\u2013[6] has the benefits of small form factor, high efficiency, extracting energy from multi-modal energy sources, and powering different types of loads. Self-powered loT applications also require the EHPMUs to have ultra-low quiescent power, wide dynamic range, and autonomous features to support their deployment without any battery. However, previous EHPMUs either consume too much power [1]\u2013[3] or only provide a small dynamic range [4], [5]. They also suffer from two-stage power delivery causing cascaded power loss [1], [5] and lack of essential components such as voltage references [6] for a fully deployable solution. To overcome all these challenges, in this work, we propose a fully autonomous MISIMO EHPMU platform that can extract energy from three energy harvesters with both AC and DC modalities and provide four custom voltage rails together with on-chip maximum power-point tracking (MPPT) and multi-modal cold start-up circuits. This EHPMU achieves 32nA quiescent current, 1.2x1 05 dynamic range, 3.2x energy-extraction gain for piezoelectric energy harvesting, and 80% efficiency when delivering $1\\mu \\mathrm{A}$ output current.",

        "abstract": "Miniaturized neural implants for monitoring neurological disorders have been investigated as a promising alternative to the neural interface for patients. However, such implants rely on physical tethers to external hardware for data and power transmission, which not only causes tissue damage and infection, but also hinders stable in vivo recordings in freely behaving animals. To enable non-tethered implants, a key feature for the robust and high-fidelity neural interface, neural implants using various wireless technologies have been reported (Fig. 20.5.1, top-left) [1]\u2013[3]. However, the use of an inductive link [1] imposes a stringent requirement on the alignment between coils, as well as a limited transfer range. Optical [2] and ultrasound [3] telemetry suffer from attenuation from skull absorption, which requires surgically placed sub-cranial repeater or has only been demonstrated at low data rates (tens of kb/s). Hence, they are limited to the short operation range and the susceptibility to orientation, and in most cases still need a headstage that restricts freedom of action.",

This challenge calls for the development of edge devices with an always-on adaptation to their target ecosystems. However, the memory requirements of conventional neural-network training algorithms scale with the temporal depth of the data being processed, which is not compatible with the constrained power and area budgets at the edge. For this reason, previous works demonstrating end-to-end on-chip learning without external memory were restricted to the processing of static data such as images [1]\u2013[4], or to instantaneous decisions involving no memory of the past, e.g. obstacle avoidance in mobile robots [5]. The ability to learn short-to-long-term temporal dependencies on-chip is a missing enabler for robust autonomous edge devices in applications such as gesture recognition, speech processing, and cognitive robotics.",

        "abstract": "Piezoelectric speakers are gaining popularity on account of their improving form-factor and audio quality, making them a good fit for many audio applications such as in televisions, laptops, etc. Such speakers can be modelled as a large capacitive load, and so are typically driven by a Class-AB amplifier via a series resistor that ensures driver stability, and limits load current, but wastes power [1], [2]. In [3], the Class-AB amplifier is replaced by a more power-efficient Class-D amplifier (CDA) in series with an additional inductor. However, a series resistor is still required to damp the resulting LC resonant circuit, which could otherwise draw excessive currents when excited by large-signal distortion (e.g. clipping) harmonics around the LC resonance frequency. Alternatively, by using a feed-forward architecture based on LC filter diagnostics to limit overshoot currents, the series resistor can be replaced by a second inductor, at the expense of increased system complexity and cost [4].",

        "abstract": "Class-D amplifiers (CDAs) are often used in audio applications due to their superior power efficiency. Due to the sensitivity of the human ear, a large dynamic range (DR) is desired, and audio DACs with up to 130dB DR are commercially available [1]. However, the DR of the CDAs they drive is typically much lower [2]\u2013[4], mainly due to the thermal noise introduced by the input resistors of their resistive feedback networks. Reducing this resistance is difficult, as it reduces the CDA's input impedance and increases the required loop-filter capacitance. Alternatively, the CDA could be configured as a capacitively coupled chopper amplifier (CCCA), whose capacitive feedback network could then achieve low noise without reducing input impedance. However, the large PWM component present at its output would then saturate its input stage. By exploiting the inherent PWM filtering present in a feedback-after-LC architecture, this paper presents a capacitively coupled chopper CDA, resulting in significantly improved DR and THD+N. The prototype achieves $8\\mu\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{RMS}}$ of integrated output noise (A-weighted), a 121.4dB DR, and -1 09.8dB THD+N while delivering a maximum of 15/26W into an $8/4\\Omega$ load with 93%/88% efficiency.",

        "abstract": "The phase noise of oscillators limits the modulation Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) in wireless communications and the SNR in high-speed data converters. The issue is particularly critical in the wireless infrastructure for 5G and beyond, where base stations and backhaul transceivers need extremely low phase noise to support wide bandwidth and spectrally efficient modulation schemes at high carrier frequency. Given the supply voltage, the phase noise in LC oscillators is reduced by scaling down the inductance and increasing power consumption. However, the Q degradation with too-small inductors sets a lower bound on phase noise [1], [2]. To overcome this limit, oscillators evolved from a single-core to multicore topologies, where N oscillators are coupled to scale down phase noise by 10log(N). This concept was exploited with two cores [1] and then extended to four [2]\u2013[4] and eight cores [5], giving ideally the phase-noise reduction of 3, 6, and 9dB, respectively. Nevertheless, mismatches between oscillators impair phase noise and penalize the figure of merit (FoM) [3]. Moreover, with the number of cores that grows exponentially, the extension of the approach for further phase-noise reduction is not practical.",

        "abstract": "Power and electromagnetic (EM) side-channel attacks (SCA) exploit data-dependent power consumption from cryptographic engines to extract embedded secret keys. While series-connected voltage regulators [1], [2] and arithmetic countermeasures like heterogenous Galois-field arithmetic [3] provide acceptable levels of side-channel leakage suppression, they cannot defend against determined adversaries. Random additive masking [4] on the other hand, provides a provably-secure solution [5] that disrupts first-order correlations between measured power/EM signatures and secret keys, while incurring $2\\times$ overhead in area and power consumption. In this paper, we demonstrate a reconfigurable AES accelerator fabricated in Intel 4 CMOS process with minimum-time-to-disclosure (MTD) $> 1\\text{B power}/\\text{EM}$ traces in on-demand SCA-resistant mode, while providing a $2.2\\times$ boost in encryption performance during a dual-core mode of operation (Fig. 34.4.1). When coupled with side-channel attack detection techniques [6], [7], this approach allows the user to operate at $> 2\\times$ AES throughput during the safe mode of operation in trusted environments, with the ability to quickly trade-off throughput for a higher level of SCA-resistance when the onset of an attack is detected. In the blind-bulk mode of operation, the accelerator randomly switches at a user-specified rate between SCA-resistant and dual-core modes while encrypting bulk data, providing $1.14-\\text{to}-1.6\\times$ boost in encryption throughput with measured MTD $> 50\\mathrm{M}$ traces.",

        "abstract": "The bandwidth of parallel DRAM I/O has increased to meet big-data requirements. High bandwidth memory (HBM) interfaces use up to 1024 pins, and with an increased clock frequency, their power consumption has also increased [1]. Figure 28.5.1 shows four HBM interface approaches. Conventional HBM interfaces use a termination-less structure at the receiver to reduce power consumption. For higher data rates receiver-side termination can be used to improve signal integrity. However, this causes a large static current for long consecutive identical digits (CID). Di-code signaling can be used in HBM interfaces to reduce this static current. Nevertheless, there are still design constraints for conventional di-code interfaces, such as equalization, offset voltage, and series capacitor implementation constraints [2]. The series capacitor, specifically, causes frequency dependence and parasitic capacitance, which degrades its frequency range. In this paper, a capacitor-less and high-efficiency di-code transceiver using trans-impedance-amplifier (TIA) termination is implemented, as shown in Fig. 28.5.1. An adjustable inverter-based TIA is adopted for DC balancing the di-code signaling. A common-mode voltage calibration technique is proposed to minimize the static current during middle-level transmission. Several equalizing techniques for the di-code signaling are proposed to increase the sampling margin at the receiver and to maintain the common-mode voltage of di-code outputs. Also, an error correction circuit (ECC), based on di-code signaling, is implemented to reduce bit errors.",

        "abstract": "High-resolution ($>$ 100dB SNDR), kHz-BW ADCs are required by emerging Io $\\top$ and smart sensing applications. These ADCs are desired for their high efficiency, but low cost and ease of integration are also required, especially to be compatible with the advanced CMOS processes that the loT processor prefers. The state-of-the-art solutions in this scenario, such as the zoom ADC [1], the DT or CT-DSM [2]\u2013[3], and the SAR ADC [4] and its noise-shaping variants [5], have already achieved great energy efficiency with >180dB FOMs. However, most of them are large in area, and rely heavily on the analog performance of old CMOS technologies with high supply voltages. In this work, we propose a new architecture that combines the counting ADC and CT-incremental-DSM (CT-IDSM) in a zoom ADC framework. The proposed architecture is not only power efficient, but also compact in area, highly digital, and friendly to process down-scaling. It operates at Nyquist sampling, supporting single-shot conversion and channel multiplexing. Besides this, it provides a high-impedance input with full-scale common-mode rejection, allowing direct driving by many signal sources. Fabricated in 28nm CMOS, the prototype zoom-incremental-counting (ZIC) ADC is measured to have 103dB SNDR at 20kSa/s, consuming 475 $\\mu$ W from a 0.9V supply. The resulting 176dB FOMs is comparable to the state-of-the-art designs. It occupies only 0.014mm2, which is a magnitude or two smaller than most reported ADCs with $>$ 90dB SNR.",

However, a key missing component in such systems is actuation, which could enable a host of new applications. Recently, a new class of electrochemical actuators that operate at low voltage and low power were developed [8]. The lithographic fabrication of these actuators is CMOS compatible, offering an unprecedented opportunity to create micron-scale, monolithic micro-robots. From a circuit point of view, such micro-robots face three design challenges: 1) energy harvesting and voltage generation in ultra-small form factor; 2) a customized processor for compute efficiency with stringent area budget; 3) an energy and area-efficient communication link.",

        "abstract": "Many envisioned IoT applications are not realizable today due to the mW-level power burden of wireless communication circuits for the most popular consumer standards: WiFi and BLE. To help enable new IoT applications, WiFi backscatter communication techniques have been shown to enable a \u223c1, 000\u00d7 reduction in power consumption over conventional transceivers while maintaining WiFi standard compatibility [1]\u2013[3]. However, pragmatic deployment is currently hindered by their limited range, and lack of IC implementations for BLE [4]\u2013[5]. For example, [3] and [1] only operate with inter- access point (AP) distances of 16m and 21m, respectively, which is not quite sufficient for robust operation in dense office environments, or large smart warehouses or airports with larger (and therefore lower cost) inter-AP deployment distances. Since backscatter modulation is passive with no RF power amplification, additional range can only be achieved by reducing insertion loss or adding antenna gain. For example, the work in [2] replaced 500 absorbing terminations with reactive terminations to reduce insertion loss over [1] and improve range to 26m, though a bulky and lossy Wilkinson power splitter/combiner was still required. The work in [2] also introduced a way to utilize multiple antennas to achieve MIMO-like antenna gain, though only in a static retro-reflective manner with no beam steering capabilities. This latter approach requires two co-located APs, which have self-interference challenges, and are thus not readily available in existing mesh networks. In addition to range challenges, there are no current backscatter ICs that can operate with BLE.",

        "abstract": "Data communication in the 300GHz band has found renewed interest in the past few years. Two reasons can account for this trend. First, the IEEE 802.15.3d standard was established in 2017 for radios in the unallocated frequency band from 252GHz to 322GHz [1]. Second, a number of researchers have demonstrated the viability of such radios in CMOS technology [2]\u2013[5]. For 300GHz transceivers to serve as an attractive complement to WiFi and WiGig, they should perform extensive beam forming so as to overcome the path loss. This point underscores the importance of low power consumption per element. Moreover, high-order modulation schemes require a local oscillator (LO) signal with very low phase noise. Unfortunately, the generation and distribution of LO phases proves extremely power hungry, making the realization of a single-chip 300GHz CMOS data-communication radio a difficult challenge.",

        "abstract": "PAM-4 wireline transmitters operating at 224Gb/s can employ a 56GHz PLL for multiplexing. Such an environment poses several constraints on the design. First, the PLL rms jitter must be no more than a few percent of the symbol period, 8.93ps, dictating values around $100\\text{fs}_{\\text{rms}}$. Second, the PLL should preferably provide fractional-N operation so as to accommodate different crystal frequencies. Third, in a multi-lane system, it is desirable to avoid distributing a 56GHz clock over long interconnects, hence the need for a lower-power, compact PLL that can be used within each lane. Prior fractional-N designs in this frequency range have achieved rms jitters ranging from 200 to 500fs while consuming beween 31 and 46mW and occupying areas from 0.38 to 0.55mm2 [1]\u2013[4]. This paper introduces a PLL with a jitter of 110fs that draws 23mW and occupies an area of 0.1 mm2 in 28nm CMOS technology.",

        "abstract": "Galvanically isolated voltage regulators (GIVRs) are widely used in industrial automation, electric vehicles, and medical devices to deliver power to low-voltage circuits across isolated domains and ensure human safety and device reliability in hazardous environments. Traditional bulky transformer-based GIVRs can deliver 2W output power with 80% peak efficiency [1]. However, transformers are relatively expensive, and their size limits the overall physical size of the system from being further minimized. Inductive GIVRs using micro transformers have been introduced in [2]\u2013[9] with a significantly reduced form factor; however, their efficiency is also significantly compromised to around 50% [2]\u2013[4], or even lower in the 7-to-40% range [5]\u2013[9]. This is mainly due to the much lower quality of the micro transformers compared to traditional ones, as well as the associated much higher switching frequency. In addition, the manufacturing/packaging may introduce extra cost due to the need for special processes [2], [3], [5], [6]. A capacitive GIVR has been introduced in [10]; however, the efficiency is also limited to 50.7%, with a maximum power capacity of only 62mW. Besides, common-mode transient (CMT) immunity (CMTI), which ensures the robustness of operation when fast and strong voltage transients happen between the isolated domains due to current/voltage spikes in motor drivers or other fast switching applications, is an important specification for galvanically isolated devices [2], [4], [8]. This is especially important for capacitive designs due to the direct capacitive links between the two domains. However, no discussions, mitigations, or measurements were provided in [10]. In addition, most state-of-the-art designs require an extra transformer [2], [3], [6] or a pair of capacitors [4], [10] to establish feedback links for voltage regulation, which also increase the cost and form factor, or they only work in open loop [5], [7], [9].",

        "abstract": "CMOS image sensors (CISs) with deep-submicron pixels are now in high demand, as high-end mobile devices are equipped with multiple camera modules that are used for ultra-high-resolution imaging [1], [2]. The biggest challenges with small pixels are to maintain dynamic range (DR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and sensitivity compatible with a sensor with larger pixels. A back-illuminated stacked sensor with front deep-trench isolation (FDTI) and shallow-trench isolation (STI) for inter-pixel and inter-node isolation respectively appears promising for continuous pixel-size reduction in terms of maximizing DR with large full-well capacity (FWC) while minimizing optical/electrical crosstalk [3]\u2013[5]. However, dark current may increase by strong electric fields (e-field) near defective FDTI interfaces if more doping is applied to a small photodiode (PD) to increase FWC. In addition, the FDTI/STI structure limits the area of in-pixel transistor amplifiers, and it may deteriorate dark temporal noise (TN) as pixel pitch becomes smaller. Furthermore, optical crosstalk between different color filters (CFs) is more problematic as pixel size enters the sub-wavelength scale. In this work, a back-illuminated 64Mpixel CIS with $0.56\\mu\\mathrm{m}$ -pitched pixels is reported. We present pixel designs and fabrication processes that achieve competitive FWC, dark current, TN, and optical performances with small pixels.",

        "abstract": "LC VCOs with low phase noise (PN) and an octave frequency-tuning range (FTR) are required for multistandard communication devices, software-defined radios, and wireline data links. A viable popular approach is to exploit multicore mode-switching VCOs for two reasons: (1) their PN improves linearly by in-phase coupling of N identical VCOs; (2) the resonant-mode switching enhances the VCO FTR without degrading the tank quality factor (Q) as no RF current ideally flows through lossy mode-selection switches. However, it is still challenging for dual-mode VCOs to achieve a competitive FoM while covering an octave FTR at oscillation frequencies $(\\mathrm{F}_{\\text{OSC}})$ above 6GHz [1]. To enhance the number of oscillation modes to 3, [2] added a center-loop inductor $(\\mathrm{L}_{\\mathrm{C}})$ to a transformer, as shown in Fig. 9.2.1. However, a large FTR gap is measured, since the transformer windings should be strongly coupled to accommodate $\\mathrm{L}_{\\mathrm{C}}$, The authors of [3] and [4] realized a triple- and quad-mode operation, respectively, by coupling two individual transformer-based resonators (see Fig. 9.2.1). Apart from the large area penalty, the former needs an extra third winding $(\\mathrm{L}_{\\mathrm{T}})$ in each transformer that degrades the tank Q, while the latter used large, fixed coupling capacitors $(\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{M}})$ that load the tank in two of the resonant modes, thus limiting the VCO FTR.",

Although most prior work focuses on analog-based CIM (ACIM) to leverage the BL charge/discharge operation, the lack of accuracy caused by transistor variation and the ADC is an issue [1]\u2013[3]. In contrast, a digital-based CIM (DCIM) approach realizes enough accuracy and flexibility for various input and weight bit widths [4], while also benefiting from technology scaling. This paper proposes a 64kb DCIM macro using a one-read and one-write (1R1W) 12T bitcell. The DCIM macro can realize simultaneous MAC + write operations and wide range dynamic voltage-frequency scaling (DVFS) due to the 12T cell's 1R1W functionality and low-voltage operation. Further improvements in power-performance-area (PPA) are obtained by optimizing the circuit architecture and layout topology.",

        "abstract": "Counteracting side-channel attacks has become a basic requirement in secure integrated circuits handling physical or sensitive data through cryptography, and preventing information leakage via power and electromagnetic (EM) emissions. Over time, the implementation of protection techniques against power analysis and EM attacks has progressively moved from design-specific (i.e., requiring redesign for their reuse [1]\u2013[3]) to design-reusable frameworks [4]\u2013[10], facilitating reuse with no modifications across designs, system security verification, and reducing the area/power overhead through reuse of existing silicon infrastructure across secure design IPs on the same die. Accordingly, embedding protection into regulators has been extensively explored to degrade the attack SNR and increase the minimum traces to key disclosure (MTD) via current equalization [4], a switching regulator with randomized loop control [5], a digital LDO (DLDO) with noise injection [6], a DLDO with randomized thresholds and AES transformations [7], a DLDO based on an edge-chasing quantizer [8], current-domain signature attenuation [9] and an additional time-varying transfer function [10]. Such protections allow design reuse and some degree of power-security flexibility, but have common limitations in that: 1) they indiscriminately compensate the entire large-signal power rather than focusing on small-signal information-sensitive power contributions, preventing power overhead reductions, 2) the level of protection is set at design time, and cannot improve after chip fabrication (no learning), 3) they cannot adapt to mitigate newly discovered side-channel vulnerabilities and attacks. Indeed, power overhead and security upgrade-ability over time are crucial in energy-autonomous systems with long lifespans and in applications where device replacement is expensive or unfeasible (e.g., IoT, implantables).",

        "abstract": "Despite recent progress on building highly efficient deep neural network (DNN) accelerators, few works have targeted improving the end-to-end performance of deep-learning tasks, where inter-layer pre/post-processing, data alignment and data movement across memory and processing units often dominate the execution time. An improvement to the end-to-end computation requires cohesive cooperation between the accelerator and the CPU with highly efficient data flow management. Figure 15.2.1 shows the most commonly used heterogeneous architecture, containing a CPU core and an accelerator with data communication managed by a DMA engine. However, there remain the challenges of low utilization of PE cores and large latency due to the CPU workload and data movement across processing cores [1]\u2013[4]. As shown in Fig. 15.2.1, in an end-to-end deep learning task, the accelerator is often utilized at only 30-50% with the rest of time waiting for CPU processing and data movement between the CPU and accelerator cores. Some prior works have considered data compression, reduction of data movement or improvement of memory bandwidth. For instance, an accelerator coherency port (ACP) was designed to request data directly from the last level cache of the CPU instead of using the DMA engine to improve the efficiency of data transfer [3], [5]. In this work, we propose a new architecture, a systolic neural CPU (SNCPU), which fuses the operation of a conventional CPU and a systolic CNN accelerator in a single core. The contributions of this work include: 1) The proposed SNCPU architecture can be flexibly reconfigured into a multi-core RISC-V CPU or a systolic CNN accelerator, leading to PE utilization of over 95% for end-to-end operation; 2) with an overhead of less than 10%, the CNN accelerator can be reconfigured into a 10-core RISC-V CPU to improve throughput significantly compared with a conventional heterogeneous architecture having a CPU and an accelerator; 3) with a special bi-directional dataflow, expensive data movement for inter-layer pre/post-processing across cores can be avoided; 4) we demonstrate the SNCPU through a 65nm test chip with 39-to-64% latency improvement and 0.65-to-1.8TOPS/W energy efficiency on end-to-end image-classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "A self-powered IoT system-on-chip (SoC) reduces power to sub-\u03bcw and employs multiple power-management techniques to trade-off ultra-low power (ULP), higher performance, smaller energy harvester footprint, and longer operating lifetime. Minimum Energy Point Tracking (MEPT) [1]\u2013[4] keeps an SoC operating at the minimum energy point (MEP) to enhance system lifetime. Previous sample-and-hold MEPT schemes need frequent voltage comparisons and a high-frequency clock that increases power [2]. Current-ratio-based MEPT relies on specialized CMOS technology for body-bias tuning [3]. A switched-capacitor-based MEPT can achieve energy minimization at a targeted performance [4], but it uses a 30MHz clock $\\text{wit}\\mu \\mathrm{W}$ power consumption and low power efficiency. For ULP IoT applications, SoCs need to have ultra-low quiescent power, high efficiency for energy delivery, performance scaling based on available energy, and energy minimization to increase system lifetime. In this work, we propose an ULP IoT SoC with a triple-mode power management unit (PMU) that integrates energy-performance scaling, event-driven fast DVFS, and MEPT features to improve the system energy efficiency, as shown in Fig. 13.8.1. This work achieves a minimum 194nW power consumption for the SoC and 5.2nW quiescent power for the PMU with a 92.6% peak efficiency and >104 dynamic range. The timing waveform in Fig. 13.8.1 (bottom), demonstrates the transition of the three modes including energy aware (EA), performance aware (PA), and MEPT based on event priority and input voltage level which reflects the energy availability.

        "abstract": "Epilepsy is a common neurodegenerative disease that affects more than 50 million people worldwide. Closed-loop neuromodulation is a promising solution to epileptic seizure control through an implantable device that delivers stimulation when seizures are sensed. Figure 33.2.1 shows an overview of a closed-loop neuromodulation system that includes a neural-signal acquisition unit for extracting EEGs, a neural signal processor for sensing seizures, and a stimulation unit for electrical stimulation. For epileptic states, a seizure onset indicates where a seizure begins, followed by intense brain activity. Several seizure detectors [1] [2] having reasonable performance have been proposed to sense seizures after onset. However, patients may still suffer from epileptic syndromes, depending on the severity of the seizures. The syndromes can be eliminated if the seizures can be predicted before onset. This also reduces the amount of required stimulation current, thereby extending the battery life of the implantable device. However, the computational complexity of an accurate seizure prediction algorithm is very high, considering a machine learning kernel is usually embedded to tackle the time-varying characteristics of EEGs adaptively. Up to tens of minutes is needed for seizure prediction on a high-end CPU and a real-time, energy-efficient seizure predictor has never been demonstrated in the literature. This work presents a neural signal processor with adaptable intelligence for real-time seizure prediction with low energy.",

        "abstract": "Beyond-10GHz frequency synthesizers are ubiquitous building blocks for today's ever-growing wireless and wireline communication systems. To meet the stringent requirements on data-rate and modulation schemes, the phase noise of the frequency synthesizers must be minimized. On the other hand, since low-noise and low-cost crystal oscillators operate in the MHz range, a > 10GHz frequency synthesizer demands a very large multiplication factor M (typically 400\u20131000), which poses new challenges. Although cascading PLLs helps reduce M per stage, it causes a significant power overhead and unwanted coupling between the two VCOs. Therefore, direct high M-factor frequency synthesis with low phase noise and low power consumption becomes a compelling approach.",

They usually rely on analog CIM techniques to achieve high-efficiency NN inference with low-precision INT multiply-accumulation (MAC) support [1]. Different from edge DL, cloud DL has higher accuracy requirements for NN inference and training, which demands extra support for high-precision floating-point (FP) MAC. As shown in Fig. 15.5.1, applying CIM techniques to cloud DL has three main limitations: 1) FP MAC has tightly coupled exponent alignment and INT mantissa MAC. Implementing complex exponent alignment in memory will harm CIM's direct accumulation structure and reduce efficiency. 2) FP MAC's energy is dominated by INT mantissa MAC. Further acceleration on CIM-based INT MAC is critical for processor efficiency. 3) Previous cloud DL processors usually have separate FP and INT engines, but only activate one engine at once [2], which causes high area overhead and low resource utilization.",

Due to the large number of I/Os, each transceiver (TRX) design must fit within a small area and be energy-efficient. One challenge in TRX design is the increasing clocking area and power. Distributing the clock to thousands I/Os, while satisfying stringent duty cycle constraints, requires many duty-cycle correction (DCC) and duty-cycle detection (DCD) circuits. For reliable data recovery with a reduced eye opening, RXs also require precise clock and data recovery (CDR) or clock and data alignment (CDA) circuits. Their area and power also needs to be minimized, as these circuits are employed in proportion to the I/O count.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid developments in big data analytics, non-isolated 48V-to-1V converters offer a competitive choice to support the increased power consumptions in CPUs and memories. For realizing a small output-to-input conversion ratio (CR), the conventional buck (CB) converters suffer from extremely short switch on-time that limits high-frequency operation and incurs high power losses. Although the switched-capacitor (SC) converters with lower voltage rating devices can scale down the high input voltage, $\\mathsf{V}_{\\mathsf{lN}}$, high efficiency can only be achieved under fixed conversion ratios. Hybrid converters are thus emerged recently to combine the advantages of CB and SC converters. Converter topologies such as flying-capacitor multi-level (FCML) [1] and hybrid Dickson (HD) [2] adopt an external output LC filter after the SC network to realize continuous conversion range. However, since flying capacitor in [1] and [2] requires proper voltage balancing in the steady state, the switching frequency, $\\mathsf{f}_{\\mathsf{SW}}$, can be significantly slowed down when the converter needs to balance an increased number of the flying capacitor under small CR condition. Both double step-down (DSD) [3] and tri-state DSD [4] topologies can double $\\mathsf{f}_{\\mathsf{SW}}$ by using two inductors, but their CR is only $\\mathsf{D}/2$ that limits their capability to support 48V-to-1V conversions. Although the 12-level series-capacitor converter [5] topology significantly decreases the CR, it requires 11 flying capacitors and a $\\mathsf{GaN}$ FET as external components. The converter also has 24 on-chip power transistors to support 12-phase operation, resulting in a large chip area.",

It begins with a paper describing a photon-counting 1Mpixel 143dB-DR image sensor based on charge-focusing SPAD. Two SPAD-based flash LiDAR papers present background light rejection capability, first a reconfigurable 64\u00d764 pixels with inter-pixel coincidence detection and first-last event detection schemes followed by an 80\u00d760 in-pixel histogramming TDC with quaternary searched time gating and \u0394-intensity phase detection. An iToF range sensor approaching sub-mm precision is then presented. After the smallest all-directional autofocus (AF) pixels are described, a dual-mode imager on a single sensor with high-resolution viewing and low-power always-on motion detection is presented. An ADC-less energyefficient image sensor is introduced, followed by an aggressive pixel scaling resulting in the smallest-to-date 0.56\u03bcm pixels. The session ends with a display driver IC with the smallest channel size of 2688\u03bcm2.",

        "abstract": "Recently, the number of hot spots on chips has increased due to the high performance of SoCs, which is rapidly increasing overall chip temperature. As a result, dynamic thermal management (DTM) using a number of temperature sensors is essential. For accurate temperature measurement, the sensors should be placed close to heat sources. For this reason, although the main sensor is located outside the CPU, the sensing part is directly inserted into the logic in the form of remote probes, as shown in Fig. 13.6.1 [1]. However, the remote probe, which is composed of BJT or resistor, needs physical distance from the logic for improving gate-area uniformity and signal routing to the main sensor. In addition, the DTM period is inevitably long due to the time multiplexing and the requirement of setup time for analog blocks. Therefore, it is necessary to make the main sensor synthesizable and compact so that it can be inserted into the logic. However, BJT-based temperature sensors are not compatible with sub-1V supplies because of the base-emitter voltage of BJTs. It is also hard to design resistor-based temperature sensors in advanced processes since the resistors have been developed towards a zero temperature coefficient ratio (TCR). On the other hand, ring-oscillator-based temperature sensors composed of only transistors are suitable for integration into logic [2]. However, these sensors are sensitive to PVT variations and have leakage problems at high temperatures, so the sensing range is limited. This paper presents a fully synthesizable digital temperature sensor in 5nm FinFET CMOS. Since the sensor is based on wire metal as a proportional-to-absolute-temperature (PTAT) device, it can be integrated into hot-spot logic and is compatible with technology processes. The readout circuitry is based on a SAR-delay locked loop (DLL) for fast conversion. In addition, since the sensor uses only a digital logic supply, the power can be merged with logic power without the requirement of additional power balls.",

        "abstract": "Demand for higher aggregate data rates in digital computing and storage services requires higher per-lane throughput, better reliability, and improved power- and area-efficiency. Support for a range of data transmission protocols in a single IP reduces risk, cost, and time to market. Beyond 56Gb/s, most SerDes IPs have adopted ADC-based architectures. While ADC-based receivers can offer higher link margin and higher data-rates at the cost of power and area, the difficulty of implementing higher DFE taps poses a challenge for reflective and noisy channels. On the other hand, analog designs must meet the tap1 timing constraint and require accurate slicers operating across process and temperature variation. Specific design techniques are required to overcome these challenges. Previously reported speculative decision schemes are not efficient in PAM-4 due to the large number of slicers and multiplexers required. This paper presents the receiver of an analog multi-protocol SerDes transceiver at data rates of 2-58Gb/s PAM-4 and 1-32Gb/s NRZ with 16 data and 3 edge DFE taps. This transceiver fully supports both Ethernet/OIF and PCI-Express Gen1-4 as well as full or partial support of CPRI, JESD, USB, SATA, GPON, HDMI, DisplayPort, OTN, SDI, and SONET. Circuit techniques applied include background slicer threshold optimization using dynamic swapping, DFE taps with cross-coupled MOS capacitors and cascode devices for load isolation, edge taps and sampling point optimization. This receiver achieves pre-FEC BER<10\u22124 over dynamic temperature variation of -20C to 105C in a 10nm process technology and channel insertion loss of 5-33dB compliant with the Ethernet standard. Receiver area is 0.14mm2 and power at 58.125Gb/s is 259mW from 1V and 1.8V supplies.",

        "abstract": "Mm-wave 5G communication seeks to support multi-Gb/s data-rates over its large available spectrum, particularly in the K/Ka bands (24 to 40GHz). To ensure sufficient link budget under mm-wave path losses, array-based systems are required. However, element coupling in practical antenna arrays varies each antenna load from its ideal $50\\Omega$ impedance (i.e., VSWR = 1). Power amplifiers (PAs) govern the overall transmitter (Tx) performance yet are the most susceptible blocks to VSWR variation, as they interface directly with antennas. The antenna VSWR alters the PA load, degrading the PA linearity, efficiency, output power, and reliability. Multiple proposed reconfigurable PAs maintain the PA performance under VSWR but require VSWR resilient built-in-self-test (BiST), particularly on-chip power and impedance sensors, to determine the PA operation/reconfiguration. Previous work on power detectors is primarily based on voltage sensing, which only tracks the true RF power for a fixed and known real load. The works in [1] and [2] detect both load current and voltage to measure the real RF power over VSWR. However, both only properly operate for differential PAs, while most mm-wave front-end/antenna interfaces require single-ended connections. Meanwhile, reported impedance detectors consist of either an equivalent passive series element or shunt element with large capacitive loading [3]\u2013[5]. These designs inevitably add loss, limit the PA output-matching-network (OMN) bandwidth (BW), and change the OMN impedance transformation. The authors of [6] demonstrate VSWR-resilient joint power-and-impedance sensing at mm-wave but only at a single frequency. To overcome these issues, we demonstrate a single-ended broadband VSWR-resilient joint true-power/impedance sensor. While the proposed sensor is realized with and without an integrated PA on a Wilkinson power combiner (WPC) under both small- and large-signal CW operation, it can be applied on any single-ended RF/mm-wave signal trace and is agnostic to PA designs.",

        "abstract": "Molecular electronics is the concept of integrating single molecules into circuits as functional elements. For nearly 50 years, this has been envisioned as a way to extend Moore's Law to physical scaling limits [1]. However, beyond scaling advantages, using single molecules in circuits as sensor elements enables a broad range of biomolecular sensing applications that integrated circuits cannot otherwise perform. Unlike classical biosensors that rely on indirect reporter methods to detect molecular probe-target interactions (e.g., as in Fig. 12.6.1 with optical, enzymatic, or magnetic reporters), in the molecular electronics approach, current directly passes through a probe molecule, whose interactions with a target molecule are detected through modulation of the probe molecule's conductance [2]. This approach enables label-free, ultra-sensitive, real-time, all-electronic single-molecule sensors to be deployed on low-cost, highly scalable CMOS sensor array chips. The resulting platform extends these \u201con-chip\u201d advantages to a wide variety of biosensing applications, such as in diagnostics, drug discovery, DNA sequencing, and proteomics [3]\u2013[5].",

        "abstract": "With the combined merits of SAR and \u0394\u03a3 ADCs, the noise-shaping (NS) SAR architecture can achieve high resolution with a mild OSR, making it versatile for a wide range of applications. Nonetheless, designing a highly power-efficient NS-SAR under relatively low OSRs (<8) can be challenging. It requires the design to concurrently address two key considerations. The first is to implement high-order optimized NS with simple and low-power hardware that maximally preserves the efficient nature of the SAR. In this regard, two recent works report 4th-order NS using a cascaded EF structure [1] and an FVF-assisted CIFF structure [2] respectively, both allowing aggressive NTFs to be realized with simple open-loop amps. However, they still employ static amps/buffers, which limit the power improvement. Also, the lack of NTF optimization makes them non-ideal for low OSR designs. The second concern is the growing kT/C noise contribution under low OSR and the related large stress on the input driver. To alleviate this issue, ref [3] presents an NS-SAR with a loop-embedded input buffer that decouples the input capacitance from the kT/C noise constraint; but it suffers from a large noise penalty introduced by the buffer and the separated CDAC. Alternatively, a sampling noise cancellation (SNC) technique is proposed in [4] to facilitate a smaller CDAC value. However, owing to imperfect cancellation caused by circuit non-idealities, the CDAC can remain considerably large.",

        "abstract": "With the advent of ultra-fast charging and foldable phones, the number of smart phones that use two batteries are gradually increasing [1]. In ultra-fast charging applications, two batteries are connected in series as shown in Fig. 30.3.1. The output voltage of the adapter is varied according to the battery voltage using communication between the adapter and smartphone to control the battery charging current. By connecting the batteries in series, twice the charging power can be obtained with the same current. However, since the battery output voltage is high, a separate converter must be always working to supply the system power. Furthermore, the loss of the converter reduces the usable battery capacity. Also, there is a disadvantage in that a buck-boost switching charger [2], [3] is required to support a general adapter whose output voltage is not controllable. In a foldable phone, the battery capacity can be increased by mounting the battery under two screens. In that case, two batteries are generally connected in parallel as shown in Fig. 30.3.1, and each battery requires a charging current limiter. The traditional buck charger can be used as is, but there is a disadvantage in that the direct charging efficiency is lower than that of the serial battery system. The series-parallel battery system in Fig. 30.3.1 is a combination of the advantages of the series battery system and the parallel battery system. In a series-parallel battery system [4], [5], when direct charging using a switch network, the batteries are connected in series, and when a general adapter is connected or an adapter is not connected the batteries are connected in parallel. When the batteries are connected in series, if the bottom battery supplies the system load, the voltage difference between the two batteries will occur. In this state, when batteries are connected in parallel, excessive in-rush current flows, so an additional balancing circuit is required. The proposed 1-chip series-parallel battery charger in Fig. 30.3.1 compensates for the shortcomings of the existing series-parallel battery systems. The proposed structure consists of a switching charger, a direct charger, and a battery switch, and the charging current limit function and the Qbat role of the buck charger are implemented in Q5 and Q6 of the battery switch. By using the proposed structure, it is possible to achieve high-speed charging through battery series connection, stable system power supply through battery parallel connection, and stable balancing through each battery current limit function.",

        "abstract": "One of the salient hurdles for wide adoption of machine learning (ML) has been efficient and high-performance edge compute. ML developers use very large, expensive, and power-intensive systems to create new models, but the final implementation needs to be deployed in a cost-effective, small, and low-power solution. This has commonly led to situations where the models that can be deployed in an edge environment are significantly smaller than state-of-the-art models leading the benchmark scoreboards [1]. A flash-based Analog Matrix Processor (AMP) is well positioned to close this development/deployment gap by providing edge inference compute that is 10-to-100\u00d7 more efficient than traditional digital inference. It accomplishes this by leveraging denser circuitry via smaller memory elements (multi-level flash instead of several SRAM cells) and denser communication (256+ level signaling instead of binary signaling). Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are an ideal application for the AMP since they can use analog-aware training to overcome the inherent non-idealities present in analog signal chains. DNNs use large pattern matchers which naturally suppress noise and map well to the AMP, which prefers to amortize the fixed costs inside the analog system over larger calculations.",

The SVM operation [1]\u2013[3] typically comprises of (1) in the offline phase, the extracted raw vectors $(\\vec{V}_{RAW})$ are obtained from machine learning approaches and stored in non-volatile NAND Flash; (2) in the online phase, a processor request $\\vec{V}_{RAW}$ data from edge storage; (3) the entire $\\vec{V}_{RAW}$ dataset is moved from storage to the processor; (4) the processor scores the similarities between an input query and each candidate $\\vec{V}_{RAW}$ and provide a best match. However, the large-amount data movement across the memory hierarchy consumes a large amount of energy $(\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{M}\\mathrm{E}\\mathrm{M}})$, while also resulting in a long search-latency $(\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{R}})$ for SVM operations.

To reducing data movement will lower $\\mathrm{E}_{\\mathrm{M}\\mathrm{E}\\mathrm{M}}$ and $\\mathrm{t}_{\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{R}}$; edge storage with nonvolatile computing-in-memory (nvCIM) support for similarity computation (vector-vector multiplication (VVM) for cosine similarity) is required to reduce the $\\vec{V}_{RAW}$ dataset to a small candidate size. However, there are challenges in leveraging 3D NAND for VVM operations: (1) a low-readout accuracy when there is a large amount of current summation by using the wide range $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t}}$ -level of cells ($\\mathrm{e}.\\mathrm{g}., 1^{\\mathrm{s}\\mathrm{t}}$ to $4^{\\mathrm{t}\\mathrm{h}}\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{t}}$ -level of TLC cell) and (2) the large readout power consumption required to achieve a constant settling time against a wide range of summation currents for the possible data-patterns.",

        "abstract": "Closed-loop neuromodulation can alleviate disease symptoms and provide sensory feedback in various neurological disorders and injuries [1]. Energy-efficient realization of closed-loop devices with on-site classification is critical to enhancing therapeutic efficacy. Despite recent advances, existing SoCs with integrated machine learning are constrained by low channel count (8\u201332) [2]\u2013[5] and poor generalizability. To address these limitations, this paper presents a versatile neuromodulation SoC that integrates: (1) a 256-channel area-efficient dynamically addressable analog front-end (AFE), (2) information-rich multi-symptom biomarkers, (3) a low-power tree-structured hierarchical neural network (NeuralTree) classifier, and (4) a 16-channel high-voltage (HV) compliant neurostimulator.",

        "abstract": "Accurate current sensing is critical in many industrial applications, such as battery management and motor control. Precise shunt-based current sensors have been reported with gain errors of less than 1% over the industrial temperature range (-40\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C) [1]\u2013[4]. However, since they are intended for coulomb counting, their bandwidth is limited to a few tens of Hz, making them unsuitable for battery impedance or motor-current sensing. This paper presents a current sensor with a wide (10kHz) bandwidth and a tunable temperature compensation scheme (TCS), which allows it to be flexibly used with different types of shunts while maintaining high accuracy. A low-cost room-temperature calibration scheme is proposed to optimize gain flatness over temperature by exploiting the shunt's self-heating at large currents. Over the industrial temperature range and a \u00b125A current range, it achieves state-of-the-art gain error (\u00b10.25%) with both low-cost PCB and stable metal-alloy shunts.",

        "abstract": "As millimeter-wave (mm-wave) 5G technology adoption expands, it faces growing technical challenges. Among these are the extension of the 28GHz band, to 24.25 to 29.5GHz (n257, n258 and n261 5G NR bands) and the demand for 5G base stations to cover large distances by using a larger number of antenna elements. While mm-wave 5G phased arrays supporting up to 256 elements have been reported [1,5-8], they suffer from two key challenges: (1) their created beams are narrow, requiring thousands of beams to cover all angles within the scan range, yet their beam tables typically support <300 beams [1], [2]; and (2) their increased power consumption may lead to severe thermal challenges, especially in situations where air-cooling cannot be used.",

        "abstract": "Emerging loT applications, such as asset tracking and first-responder rescue operation, require a new localization solution that achieves decimeter-level accuracy for long range (km) in GPS-denied indoor non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios. Impulse-response ultra-wideband radar (IR-UWB) [1]\u2013[3] can achieve high precision, but cannot operate in long distance NLOS conditions due to FCC-regulated transmit-power limits and severe pathloss through walls. Moreover, IR-UWB requires very high instantaneous power (> 70mW [2]) rendering it impractical for energy-constrained loT with small batteries and high internal resistance. Lower-power solutions with narrower bandwidth, based on WiFi [4] or Bluetooth [5], typically have a limited range of < 100m or are not operable in NLOS. A proprietary 80MHz OFDM-based solution [6] using an active-reflection IC achieved decimeter-level accuracy in NLOS conditions. However, it requires relatively high power consumption (62.8mW) with a limited range up to ~100m. Addressing this technological gap, we propose a new crystal-less low-power RF receiver with -115dBm sensitivity for long-distance (up to 483m) ranging in NLOS conditions with decimeter-level (~0.6m) accuracy.",

        "abstract": "The conventional cellular mobile device needs a tens-of-MHz main crystal oscillator (XO) and 32.768kHz real-time clock (RTC) XO for RF ultra-low-jitter PLLs and sleep operation, respectively. To minimize BoM cost and PCB area by reducing the number of crystals, the low-power main XO with a fractional divider (DIV.) in [1] is reported for the RTC. However, the high-power-consuming start-up operation for high-Q-factor main XO is inevitable. The on-chip RC oscillator (RCO) can be an alternative to the RTC XO due to its compact area and excellent stability over process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) variation. To improve the temperature sensitivity of the RCO, the two-point trimming using the resistors having the opposite temperature coefficient (TC) is employed in [2], but the accuracy is limited to 20ppm/\u00baC due to the $1^{\\text{st}}$ -order compensation. The RCOs using high-resolution temperature-sensor units (TSUs) in [3], [4] can improve the TC up to <10ppm/\u00baC. However, the TSU requires a large area and an external FPGA to address complex digital signals. In addition, the previous approaches of [2]\u2013[4] can be applied only to the limited processes providing a negative TC resistor. The main XO should accomplish ultra-low jitter for the RF PLLs (i.e $< 100{\\text{fs}}_{\\text{rms}})$, but it causes long start-up time due to a large swing of the XO. Consequently, the system stand-by power is increased. Although a precisely timed energy injection in [5] can effectively reduce the start-up time, it is only applicable when the clock swing is small (0.32V). The 2-step injection technique [6] can improve the start-up time of the XO close to the theoretical limit even with large swing, but the short-circuit current of the buffer for a reference clock of the PLL restricts the start-up energy reduction (3.4\u00d7).",

The PQC standards, which are based on multiple mathematical problems, will be available around the end of 2021 in NIST's PQC standardization (Fig. 34.1.1). Crypto-agility, coupled with new mathematical calculations, high computing complexity, and large memory consumption brings challenges to the design of PQC processors considering flexibility, throughput, and energy efficiency.",

        "abstract": "The integration of 2D ultrasonic transducer arrays and pitch-matched ASICs has enabled the realization of various 3D ultrasound imaging devices in recent years [1]\u2013[3]. As applications such as 3D intravascular ultrasonography, intra-cardiac echocardiography, and trans-fontanelle ultrasonography call for miniaturization and improved spatial resolution, higher-frequency transducers (>5MHz) with a correspondingly smaller array pitch (<150\u00b5m) are needed. Such devices generally employ a large number of transducer elements, calling for channel-count reduction in the ASIC while meeting stringent restrictions on per-element power consumption and die area. Micro-beamforming (\u00b5BF) is an effective way of reducing channel count by performing a delay-and-sum operation on the echo signals received within a sub-array [1]. However, prior \u00b5BF implementations employ per-element capacitive memory to realize the delay [1], [2], making it increasingly difficult to apply \u00b5BF in smaller-pitch arrays.",

However, despite its cost effectiveness QLC's market share is not increasing quickly, not only due to its worse reliability but also its slow sequential and random read performance. To increase random read performance an independent plane read operation has been introduced [1], [2], but the read and pass voltage noise, caused by high I/O and data-path current consumption, causes a shift in the threshold voltage $(\\mathrm{V}_{\\text{th}})$ distribution during plane-interleaved and cache read operations. Furthermore, for QLC with reduced program and erase (P/E) cycles the number raw bit errors exceeds the amount correctable by ECC. More read-retry steps need to be added to compensate, but the read latency increases.",

        "abstract": "As autonomous driving becomes commercialized, the requirements for safe and advanced integrated circuits for automotive applications have become stricter than at any other time. IS026262 (Road Vehicle Functional Safety Standard) determines the risk level associated with systematic and random failures and defines the level of risk reduction required to achieve safety levels for target applications by the automotive safety integrity level (ASIL). IS026262 has a metric for a system's ability to detect failures, diagnostic coverage (DC) and the requirement for ASIL is 90%,97%, and 99% for grade B, C and D, respectively, for the single point fault metric (SPFM). Whereas several papers have been published to satisfy the high ASIL grade at SoC level, only a few works were reported at the IP level [1]\u2013[3]. A paper was published for clock IP with various built-in self-tests [4], but none of the works have mentioned certification with ASIL grade. If the IP level satisfies the ASIL grade, additional verification is not required for ASIL certification at the SOC level. In this paper, efficient phase-locked loop (PLL) and oscillator (OSC) architecture and safety mechanisms to fulfill ASIL-D requirements are proposed.",

        "abstract": "Bioimpedance (BioZ) analysis has been recognized as a new paradigm to derive a number of body composition and hemodynamic measures in a non-invasive manner. Measuring the changes in electrical resistance of the thorax during a cardiac cycle, known as impedance cardiography (ICG), is beneficial in detecting early signs of heart failure deterioration [1]. This raises the need for power-efficient wearable BioZ sensors to enable long-term and user-friendly health monitoring, while state-of-the-art designs still suffer from a few drawbacks. First, conventional BioZ interfaces typically rely on gel electrodes (> 10cm2) for low-impedance contact between skin and electrodes [1]\u2013[2]. This not only hampers the long-term recording but also causes user discomfort. However, it is very challenging to perform small-size dry-electrode BioZ sensing at the frequency range of 1kHz to 1MHz, where both the increased electrode-tissue impedance (ETI) (-10M\u03a9II0.5nF) and input parasitic capacitance $\\mathrm{C}_{\\mathrm{p}}(> 10\\text{pF})$ play a dominating role in attenuating the input signal (Fig. 20.1.1), resulting in gain inaccuracy and a long settling time [3]. To solve this issue, a BioZ amplifier with calibrated positive feedback [3] was proposed for input impedance boosting, which enables 1cm2 dry-electrode BioZ sensing. Second, to identify small BioZ variation (0.01 to $1\\Omega$) over higher baseline impedance, i.e., ETI plus the static BioZ component, both the excitation current generator (CG) and the BioZ amplifier must feature low noise. Although dynamic element matching (DEM) is effective in alleviating the 1/f current noise of the CG [2], the input-signal-dependent noise of the amplifier remains a notable problem that severely reduces the measurement accuracy when the BioZ signal is large [4]. Furthermore, previous CGs employing complementary current sources suffer from current mismatch, resulting in low output impedance and limited voltage headroom [1]\u2013[2]. A unipolar CG solves this problem, but both the sinusoidal CG and current sink amplifier are power-hungry [3]. Finally, state-of-the-art BioZ readouts [1]\u2013[3] still require an extra electrode to bias the body and provide the input common-mode (CM) voltage, which further increases the system complexity.",

        "abstract": "In the pursuit of ever larger bandwidths, in recent years GHz-rate continuous-time (CT) oversampled ADCs have been reported in literature that achieve bandwidths of hundreds of MHz and have even exceeded the GHz barrier [1]\u2013[3]. As impressive as these bandwidths are for CT ADCs, the required ADC architectures are complex, are sensitive to layout parasitics due to the high sampling rates, and most important of all, are power hungry, consuming several hundreds of mW. In this paper, we propose a filtering rnulti-stage noise-shaping (MASH) \u0394\u03a3 ADC architecture that overcomes the abovementioned drawbacks. Passive delay compensating filters [4] are used to realize broadband and deep suppression of the input signal component at the internal filter nodes of the ADC. As a result, no interstage DACs are needed, which are commonly required to generate the quantization error replicas in a MASH \u0394\u03a3 ADC, saving substantial power and greatly reducing the parasitic load of the high-speed critical nodes. Moreover, because of the absence of signal content at the internal filter nodes, the backend stages of the MASH architecture have relaxed linearity requirements and can be implemented with simple low-power Gm-C filters. Precise excess loop delay and excess phase compensation are accomplished with a partly resistive and capacitive stabilization DAC, enabling very-high-speed operation of the \u0394\u03a3 loops. The realized MASH ADC is sampled at 5GHz and achieves 68dB/65dB DR/peak SNDR over a 360MHz bandwidth, -78dBc THD at -1dBFS for a 115MHz input signal, and consumes 158mW. Implemented in a mature 40nm CMOS technology, the ADC occupies only 0.21 mm2 core area, achieves 2\u00d7 lower power, 5dB higher Schreier FOM and 2\u00d7 lower Walden FOM compared to state-of-the-art broadband CT ADCs in advanced 16nm-28nm nodes [1]\u2013[3].",

A complete loT circuit based on TFTs requires complex digital circuits to perform embedded control and signal-processing calculations. In this work, we have demonstrated a microprocessor capable of such complex computations and showcase it by running a complex assembly code. We selected the MOS 6502 for this, as it was one of the most commonly used microprocessors in the late 1970s, when applications with embedded software started to emerge. The 6502 came in various, more advanced iterations through the following decades [1]. The Flex6502 has been fabricated in an 800nm Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (IGZO) TFT process technology, manufactured on a flexible polyimide substrate, with total thickness less than 30\u00b5m. Based on the comparison of two logic styles, pseudo-CMOS logic [2] and resistive load logic [3], we selected pseudo-CMOS as the better-suited logic family for robustness and energy efficiency. We used the assembly code of the well-known Snake game to demonstrate real-time correct operation of the circuit.",

        "abstract": "Class-D audio amplifiers have gradually become standard components in mobile devices, where better audio quality over a wide volume range and higher output power $(\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{U}\\mathrm{T}})$ are desired. However, in mobile devices, the $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{U}\\mathrm{T}}$ is limited since Li-ion batteries operate at 3 to 4.2V. To increase $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{U}\\mathrm{T}}$, prior publications [1]\u2013[3] have developed embedded boost converters to regulate boosted supply voltage $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{V}\\mathrm{D}\\mathrm{D}}$ to 5V or higher for the Class-D power stage at the expense of efficiency degradation. The top of Fig. 31.3.1 shows a typical digital-input open-loop Class-D audio amplifier, where the boost converter is operated only when high $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{U}\\mathrm{T}}$ is required. The input signal is first multiplied by the digital volume level, and then processed by an interpolator and a delta-sigma modulator (DSM) to achieve a high signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR). Next, the DSM output is converted into a PWM signal with a 384kHz switching frequency $\\mathrm{f}_{\\mathrm{S}\\mathrm{W},\\text{Class}}$) by the PCM-to-PWM converter to drive the power stage. The bottom of Fig. 31.3.1 illustrates the dominant factors of the THD+N in different $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{U}\\mathrm{T}}$ regions. In the $\\mathrm{l}\\mathrm{o}\\mathrm{w}-\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{U}\\mathrm{T}}$ region, to achieve a high dynamic range (DR), the DSM loop order should be sufficiently high for more aggressive noise-shaping ability so as to suppress the DSM-shaped quantization noise. However, this tends to overload the DSM's quantizer when the DSM input is close to full scale, resulting in a rapidly increasing THD+N due to the clipping error in the $\\text{high}-\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{U}\\mathrm{T}}$ region. As such, the maximum $\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{U}\\mathrm{T}}$ with THD+N<1 % is decreased, which squanders the boosted $\\mathrm{V}_{\\mathrm{P}\\mathrm{V}\\mathrm{D}\\mathrm{D}}$. In addition to the DSM-shaped noise, the PCM-to-PWM converter's clock (CLK) jitter noise is more significant when PWM pulses are narrower in the $\\mathrm{l}\\mathrm{o}\\mathrm{w}-\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{U}\\mathrm{T}}$ region. As for the $\\text{medium}-\\mathrm{P}_{\\mathrm{O}\\mathrm{U}\\mathrm{T}}$ region, where the minimum THD+N is usually located, the THD+N is dominated by the Class-D power-stage nonlinearities.",

Therefore, the minimum dropout (DO) voltage must be larger than the necessary gate overdrive (OV). While larger DO enables higher Ro and better PSR, it degrades the LDO power conversion efficiency (PCE). Using larger power FETs can reduce OV and DO for a target $\\mathrm{l}_{\\max}$ but at the cost of more die area. Therefore, LDO designs that provide the required high PSR while maximizing PCE and area efficiency are essential for high-performance SoCs [1].",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in audio-visual augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) demands 1) high speed (>10Mbps) data transfer among wearable devices around the human body with 2) low transceiver (TRX) power consumption for longer lifetime, especially as communication energy/b is often orders of magnitude higher than computation energy/switching. While WiFi can transmit compressed video (HD 30fps, compressed @6-12Mbps), it consumes 50-to-400mW power. Bluetooth, on the other hand, is not designed for video transfer. New mm-Wave links can support the required bandwidth but do not support ultra-low-power (<1mW). In recent years, Human-Body Communication (HBC) [1]\u2013[6] has emerged as a promising low-power alternative to traditional wireless communication. However, previous implementations of HBC transmitters (Tx) suffer from a large plate-to-plate capacitance (Cp, between signal electrode and local ground of the transmitter) which results in a power consumption of aCpV2f (Fig. 16.6.1) in voltage-mode (VM) HBC. The recently proposed Resonant HBC [6] tries to overcome this problem by resonating Cp with a parallel inductor (L). However, the operating frequency is usually < a few 10's of MHz for low-power Electro-Quasistatic (EQS) operation, resulting in a large/bulky inductor. Moreover, the resonant LCp circuit has a large settling time (\u22485Q2RCP, where R is the effective series resistance of the inductor) for EQS frequencies which will limit the maximum symbol rate to <1MSps for a 21MHz carrier (the IEEE 802.15.6 standard for HBC), making resonant HBC infeasible for> 10Mb/s applications.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of cloud computing, machine learning, and artificial intelligence is gradually saturating network workloads, necessitating rapid growth in datacenter bandwidth, which approximately doubles every 3\u20134 years. New electrical interfaces that demand dramatic increases in SerDes transceiver speed are being developed to support this. This paper presents a power-efficient 224Gb/s-PAM-4 ADC-based receiver in a 5nm CMOS process that targets next generation Ethernet for chip-to-module applications, envisioned to be the first use-case scenario at this data-rate. Doubling the data-rate from the current IEEE 802.3ck and OIF standards at 112Gb/s, while keeping the same modulation - which is desirable for maintaining backward compatibility with 112/56Gb/s electrical and optical PAM-4 standards - requires doubling the bandwidth and lowering both the clock jitter and circuit noise by a factor of two. These new constraints are met by using 1) a hybrid continuous-time linear equalizer (CTLE) incorporating both inductive peaking and source-degeneration [1] 2) heavy bandwidth extension topologies employing several types of inductive peaking, 3) a low-power interleaved ADC and 4) an inductive clock distribution network with jitter filtering.",

        "abstract": "Human brain is a natural ultimate-event-driven (UED) system with low power and real-time response-ability, thanks to the asynchronous propagation and processing of spikes. Power dissipation and latency are major concerns in AloT devices, usually operating in random-sparse-event (RSE) scenarios (Fig. 22.7.1, top). Being event-driven on the system level, an always-on wake-up system (WUS) detects the valid RSEs energy-efficiently and intelligently, and upon detection turns on the power-hungry high-performance system (HPS). Being event-driven on the module level, a prior WUS [1] uses asynchronous feature extraction and synchronous convolutional neural network to detect the RSEs, consuming 148nW-to-1.68\u00b5W with 348ms latency. On the circuit level, the Spiking Neural Network (SNN) gives natural event-driven property. However, the prior SNN works did not fully explore this nature. An SNN circuit [2] achieves keyword spotting task at 205nW-to-570nW, but the framing method causes 100ms latency and is not true real-time. The SNN core in [5] uses synchronous digital design, which consumes significant power by the clock tree. The asynchronous-in-global synchronous-in-local [3]\u2013[4] SNN circuits use local clock signals. They need arbiters in each layer to sort the spikes, weakening the parallelism and timing; additionally, the separation of storage and computing consumes more energy for data movement.",

        "abstract": "The expansion of information and communication technologies has led us to the invention of 5th-generation (5G) communications. However, as an effort to overcome the insufficient frequency-band resource in FR1, telecommunication companies are continuously securing additional re-farming bands in FR1, and they are extending maximum throughput by applying Carrier Aggregation/E-UTRA NR Dual connectivity (CA/EN-DC) based on many fragment bands as shown in Fig. 27.5.1. For example, a major telecommunication company supports CA/EN-DC of the B1, B3, B5, B7 (1), B7 (2), and n78 bands, which require more than 20 RX paths considering the antenna diversity and 4x4 MIMO needed for maximum throughput. As the demands for spectrum re-farming increase, more fragment bands are used, and the required numbers of RX paths also increase accordingly in a conventional direct-conversion-receiver (DCR) architecture. In addition, to support the various fragment bands, multiple front-end modules (FEMs) are required and each FEM needs to be highly complexed with higher-performance multiplexers such as octaplexers or hexaplexers to maintain TX-RX isolation for TX desensitization from IIP2 as shown in Fig. 27.5.1. When B1 TX and RX are activated with B3 RX simultaneously, the isolation between the B1 TX and B3 RX path is more difficult to achieve than that between the B1 TX and RX path due to the reduced duplex spacing (i.e., 40MHz from 130MHz). Also, a local-oscillator (LO) leakage power from in-band LO frequency as well as leakage powers from the adjacent LO harmonics are added to the DC offset of receiver chains. These issues can be relaxed by a multiple-channel-processing receiver with IF conversion such as a software-defined-radio (SDR) receiver or by cognitive radio (CR) receivers that can break through the shortage of FR1 band by searching and adapting unoccupied bands in real time.",

        "abstract": "Emerging bandwidth-hungry applications such as cloud computing, have significantly driven the requirement for high transmission data rates. Polarization diversity coherent detection is an indispensable technique for realizing high-capacity transmission owing to its excellent spectral efficiency. ADC-DSP-based coherent receivers [1]\u2013[2] have been widely deployed in long-haul optical systems, but the high power consumption prohibits their application in power-sensitive short-reach links like 5G mobile backhaul networks, arousing eagerness for power-efficient analog solutions. An analog coherent receiver is proposed in [3], where a single-stage equalizer is used to compensate for chromatic dispersion (CD) and rotation of state of polarization (SOP), resulting in complex inter-connection, large parasitic capacitance, and consequently limited data rate. In this paper, we present a 200Gb/s analog dual-polarization quadrature phase-shift keying (DP-QPSK) coherent optical receiver featuring a 2-stage equalizer to relax the speed limit, while consuming 10 times less power than ADC-DSP-based ones.",

        "abstract": "Imaging technologies are important in the era of drones/mobile vision systems. A CIS provides high-fidelity images with low latency, but it is vulnerable to low/complex light conditions and lacks depth information; LiDAR provides depth information but is bulky and over 50W in power [1]. An Ultrasound Imaging Sensor (UIS), on the other hand, is a promising choice for depth sensing under all-light conditions (day/night/complex); it also consumes orders of magnitude less power than LiDAR with a smaller form-factor. However, conventional UIS systems often rely on off-chip image processing [2]\u2013[4] and use multi-shot TX beamforming, causing multi-Watt power consumption and slow response. Moreover, many are designed for short-range biomedical diagnostics [2]\u2013[5] and are difficult to adapt to mid-range fast-response (sub-50ms) imaging applications such as drone/mobile vision systems. To address these issues, we present a UIS SoC that adopts 1-shot TX with a fully on-chip per-voxel RX beamfocusing (PV-RXBF) (Fig. 32.1.1). The SoC shows 7.76\u00b5s image reconstruction latency at 9.83M focal-points/s while consuming 142.3mW and covering 7m range.",

Seven industry and academic experts will address the state-of-the-art and offer insightful projections on related topics, including standard, circuit and technology. The Forum will begin with the design considerations for different standardizations of end-to-end channels at 224 Gb/s. Next, the challenges and opportunities of serial transceiver design, signaling schemes beyond PAM4, equalization, DSP, and advanced forward error correction techniques will be presented. Switching gears to the technology side of things, advancements in silicon photonic technologies to support 200Gb/s operation will be discussed. A design example on coherent optical transceiver will conclude the forum presentation.",
