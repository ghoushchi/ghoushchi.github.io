This is a tutorial on the interactive visualized convolution of two signals.

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:09.550
It lets the user visualize and calculate how the convolution of two functions is

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:10.310
determined.

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:13.510
This is often referred to as graphical convolution.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.379
The tool consists of three graphs.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.309
Top left graph two functions.

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:24.350
h(t) dash red line and f(t) solid blue line

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.319
are plotted in the top left graph.

00:00:26.969 --> 00:00:28.649
As you choose new functions,

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:31.680
these graphs will be updated top right graph.

00:00:31.879 --> 00:00:36.860
The top right graph shows three separate functions and has an independent variable

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:39.240
(i.e., axis of lambda).

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:41.500
This is important in this graph.

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:46.479
Lambda varies and t is constant shown our f lambda solid blue

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:47.990
line note,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.860
this looks just like f(t).h(t minus lambda) red

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:54.040
line note,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.169
this is reversed horizontally relative to the original because of the minus sign

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.050
on the independent variable (i.e., minus lambda) and shifted

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.779
horizontally by the an amount equal to the constant t the product f

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.339
lambda O TT minus lambda pink

00:01:13.349 --> 00:01:16.379
line and filled in with pink note.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.290
This is a function of lambda with t being a constant.

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:25.250
This function is shaded in pink as a reminder that the convolution is the integral of this

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.970
function for this particular value of tie the shaded area above

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.500
zero minus the shaded area below zero.

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:37.779
The value of t you can change the value of t by clicking and dragging within the

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.250
middle or bottom graph.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.860
The variable lambda does not appear in the final convolution.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.569
It is merely a dummy variable used in the convolution integral.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.110
See below bottom right graph.

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.330
The bottom right graph shows y(t),

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.809
the convolution of h(t) and f(t) as well as the value of t

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.010
specified in the top right graph.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.930
You can change the value of t by clicking and dragging within the top right or bottom right graph.

00:02:03.269 --> 00:02:08.250
The constant value of t from the middle graph is indicated by a black dot on the top right and

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:13.039
bottom right two graphs you can change the value of t by entering a value into the box

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.770
below or you can click and move the mouse horizontally in either of the two lower graphs.

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:22.860
The value of the convolution at start time is y(0) = 0.

00:02:23.119 --> 00:02:27.940
This value is calculated numerically and may differ slightly from an exact value.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.330
You can select two functions h(t) and f(t) to be convolved from

00:02:33.339 --> 00:02:34.559
drop down menus.

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:39.559
There are very interesting and useful functions for both of h(t) and f(t).

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.160
We recommend you to select and test those.

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:46.910
You can also choose to show the complete solution or just the solution until a specified

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:47.389
time.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.820
You can also save each graph as a file.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:51.360
In various formats.

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:56.449
PNG JPG PDF and SVG or directly print just by click and

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.800
chart context menu.

00:02:58.009 --> 00:03:00.299
Three parallel lines on top right of each plot.

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:08.069
This is useful when learning because you can try to figure out what the convolution looks like to test your

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:08.909
understanding.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.550
Thank you.
